<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>To the woman who wishes to protect her family
from preventable diseases and is anxious to fit
herself in the absence of a trained nurse to give
intelligent care to those who are sick, this revision
of the Red Cross text-book on Elementary Hygiene
and Home Care of the Sick is particularly directed.
It should appeal to men and to women who are
interested in maintaining the health of their
neighborhoods and communities and in affording
effective co√∂peration to the public health authorities.
To teachers wishing to impart protective
health information to high school pupils, the book
also should be useful as a class text as well as a
guide.</p>

<p>The war, which has caused the withdrawal from
private practice of thousands of physicians and
graduate nurses, makes it peculiarly important to
the nation for every adult to have sound knowledge
as to how to prevent contagion and epidemics,
especially by precautionary attention to home and
local sanitation. With nurses becoming more
difficult to secure, the safety of the family demands
that some member in each household know enough
about elementary nursing to make a patient
comfortable and to carry out accurately the instructions
of the physician.</p>

<p><!-- Page vi --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
The work of revision, based upon the latest
knowledge of hygiene, sanitation and methods of
home-nursing has been done by Miss Anne Hervey
Strong, Professor of Public Health Nursing,
Simmons College, under the personal direction of
the author and the National Committee on Red
Cross Nursing Service. The material has been
painstakingly read by Dr. H. W. Rucker and Dr.
Taliaferro Clarke of the United States Public
Health Service, and Lieutenant Colonel Clarence
H. Connor, Medical Corps, United States Army.
Indebtedness to Dr. H. M. McCracken, President
of Vassar College and Director of the Red Cross
Junior Membership, for his valuable suggestion
as to adapting the book for high school use as well
as for the assistance rendered by his Department,
also is gladly acknowledged.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Health and sickness, at all times momentous
factors in the welfare of our nation, now as never
before are matters of vital importance. To win
its victories both in peace and in war, the nation
needs all its citizens with all their powers, and
it is a matter of more than passing interest that,
as conservative estimates show, at least three
persons out of every hundred living in the United
States are constantly incapacitated by serious
sickness. In 1910 these seriously sick persons
numbered more than 3,000,000. Even more
significant, perhaps, is the fact that at least half
of our national sickness could be prevented if
knowledge and resources that we now possess
were fully utilized.</p>

<p>The problem of sickness is by no means peculiar
to our own day and generation. It has been a
medical, a religious, and a social problem in every
age. From the time of Job its meaning has baffled
philosophers; from his day to ours thoughtful men
have devoted their lives to searching for causes
and cures. Yet before the middle of the last century
little progress was made, either in scientific
treatment or in prevention of disease.</p>

<p><!-- Page xii --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
The invention of the microscope first made possible
a real understanding of sickness. Through
the microscope a new world was revealed,&mdash;a
world of the infinitely small, swarming with tiny
forms of animal and vegetable life. No one,
however, appreciated the significance of these
hitherto invisible plants and animals until the
latter part of the 19th century, when the great
French savant, Pasteur, proved that little vegetable
forms, now called bacteria, cause putrefaction
and fermentation, and also certain diseases
of animals and man. Pasteur's discoveries were
carried still further by other scientists, with the
result that bacteriology has revolutionized
medicine, agriculture, and many industries, and
has made possible the brilliant achievements
of modern sanitary science. For the first time
in history the prevention of epidemics has become
possible, and sickness is no longer regarded as a
punishment for sin.</p>

<p>Actual care of the sick, both in homes and in
hospitals, has always been one of the responsibilities
of women. The first general public
hospital was built in Rome in the 4th century
after Christ by Fabiola, a patrician lady. There
she nursed the sick with her own hands, and from
her day to ours extends an unbroken line of
devoted women, handing down through the<!-- Page xiii --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
centuries their tradition of compassionate nursing
service. It remained for Florence Nightingale,
however, to give to the training its technical
and scientific foundation, and thus to found the
profession of nursing. As a result of her work,
effectiveness was added to the spirit of service,
that spirit which inspires the modern nurse no
less than in an earlier day it inspired the Sisters
of Charity who died nursing the wounded on the
battlefields of Poland.</p>

<p>But different generations have different needs,
and to meet them the spirit of service must manifest
itself in widely varying ways. The sick
need care today no less than they did when St.
Elizabeth bathed the feet of the lepers; but such
limited service, however beautiful, is no longer
enough. Today we serve best by preventing sickness.
Cure of sickness and alleviation of suffering
must never be neglected; not in cure, however, but in
prevention lies the hope of modern sanitary science,
of modern medicine, and of modern nursing.</p>

<p>Nearly every woman at some time in her life
is called upon to assist in caring for the sick.
Indeed, approximately 90% of all sick persons
in the United States are cared for at home,
even in cities where hospital facilities are good.
Moreover, every woman is largely responsible
for maintaining her own health, and few escape<!-- Page xiv --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
responsibility at some time for maintaining the
health of others. For such responsibility most
women are poorly prepared. Every year in our
own country thousands of persons, many of them
babies and children, die merely because someone,
in many cases a woman, is fatally ignorant of
the laws governing sickness and health.</p>

<p>Only prolonged and careful training, such as
good hospital training-schools afford, can furnish
the skill and judgment required in nursing
persons who are seriously ill. Upon the trained
nurse the modern practice of medicine makes
great and ever-increasing demands: a nurse must
perform complicated duties, meet critical situations,
and carry out a wide variety of measures
based on scientific principles which she must
understand. Good will and sympathy are no
longer enough; amateur nursing, even when performed
with the best intentions, may involve
grave dangers for those who are seriously ill.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although it is true that a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing, it is no less
true that total ignorance may be more dangerous
still. For instance, in cases of incipient, slight,
or chronic illness, and in certain emergencies
a little knowledge may be safer far than no
knowledge at all; and no one, surely, should be
ignorant of the principles of hygiene.</p>

<p><!-- Page xv --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
The American Red Cross, recognizing the part
that women can and should play in preventing
sickness and in building up the health and vigor
of the nation, has added to its larger patriotic
services this elementary course of instruction
in hygiene and home care of the sick. The lessons
are not intended to take the place of a nurse's
training, and procedures requiring technical skill
are necessarily omitted. The object of the book
is to supply a little knowledge of sickness, which
though limited may yet be safe. The book
is also designed to set forth some general laws
of health; to make possible earlier recognition
of symptoms; to teach greater care in guarding
against communicable disease; and to describe
some elementary methods of caring for the sick,
which, however simple, are essential to comfort,
and sometimes indeed to ultimate recovery.</p>

<br />
CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF
SICKNESS</h2>

<p>Diseases of two kinds have long been recognized:
first, those transmitted directly or indirectly
from person to person, like smallpox, measles,
and typhoid fever; and second, diseases like
heart disease and apoplexy, which are not so
transmitted. These two classes are popularly
called "catching" and "not catching;" the former
are the infectious or communicable diseases,
and the latter the non-infectious or non-communicable.
The term contagious, formerly applied
to diseases supposed to be spread only by direct
contact, is no longer an accurate or useful term.</p>

<h3>THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES</h3>

<p>The invention of the microscope, as we have
seen, revealed the existence of innumerable
little plants and animals, so small that even many
millions crowded together are invisible to the
naked eye. These tiny living creatures are called
micro-organisms or germs. The plant forms are
called bacteria (singular, bacterium), and the animal<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
forms protozoa (singular, protozo√∂n). The
common belief that all or even most bacteria are
harmful is quite unfounded. As a matter of
fact, while not less than 1500 different kinds of
micro-organisms or germs are known, only about
75 varieties are known to produce disease.</p>

<p>Most bacteria belong to the class of micro-organisms
called saprophytes, which find their food
in dead organic matter, both animal and vegetable,
and cannot flourish in living tissues. These
saprophytes act upon the tissues of dead animals
and vegetables, and resolve them into simpler substances,
which are then ready to serve as nourishment
for plants higher in the vegetable kingdom.
Thus the processes which we know as fermentation
and putrefaction are due to the action of saprophytes.
Higher plants in turn furnish food for
men and animals, and so the food supply is used
over and over in different forms, making what is
known as the <i>food cycle</i>. If it were not for bacterial
activities vegetation would be robbed of its
supply of nourishment, and plant life would
speedily end; destruction of plant life would
deprive the animal kingdom of food and thus all
life would become extinct. The saprophytes
are consequently essential to the existence of both
animals and vegetables.</p>

<p>There are, however, other organisms called<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<i>parasites</i>, which can exist in living tissues of
animals or vegetables. The organisms at whose
expense the parasites live are called their <i>hosts</i>.
Parasites not only contribute nothing to their
hosts, but generally harm them by producing
poisonous substances or depriving them of food.
Some parasites are able to lead a saprophytic
existence also, but as a rule they live at the expense
of animal or plant life. Pathogenic, or
disease-producing, germs belong to the group of
parasites. The pathogenic germs which find
favorable soil in the body produce poisons called
toxins. These poisons or toxins interfere with
the bodily functions, and thus cause what we know
as communicable disease. Communicable diseases
are caused by specific germs only: that is,
a certain disease cannot develop unless its particular
germs are present; the germs of typhoid
for instance, can cause typhoid fever only, and
not tuberculosis or other disease.</p>

<p>A number of diseases are caused by micro-organisms
that are now well known. Chief among
these diseases are colds, septic√¶mia (blood poisoning),
influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid
fever, tuberculosis, whooping cough, Asiatic cholera,
bubonic plague, meningitis, tetanus ("lock
jaw"), leprosy, gonorrh≈ìa, syphilis, relapsing
fever, typhus fever, glanders, and anthrax. Micro-<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>organisms
not yet identified probably cause the
communicable diseases whose origin is not known
with certainty. These include infantile paralysis,
smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, mumps, chicken-pox,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, yellow fever,
hydrophobia (rabies), foot-and-mouth disease.
We can hardly doubt that the intensive laboratory
research now in progress will reveal in the
near future the specific germs of these diseases
also.</p>

<h3>STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF
PARASITES</h3>

<p>The group of parasites consists of two general
classes, the vegetable, and the animal. In the
former class belong the bacteria, and in the latter
the protozoa. The two classes are not sharply
differentiated, but in general the vegetable parasites
are less highly organized than the animal.</p>

<h3>BACTERIA</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Shape.</h4><p>&mdash;Bacteria are composed of single cells
and are consequently called unicellular organisms.
Under the microscope individual cells are seen to
differ in size, shape, and structure. In shape
bacteria show three different types; the rod-shaped
(bacillus), the spherical (coccus), and
the spiral (spirillum). The organisms causing<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
typhoid fever for example are a variety of bacilli,
those causing pneumonia are cocci, while those
causing Asiatic cholera are spirilla.</p>

</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Size.</h4><p>&mdash;Bacteria vary greatly in size. Average
rod-shaped bacteria are about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25000</sub> of an inch
long, but there are undoubtedly organisms so
small that they cannot be seen, even by means
of the strongest microscopes we now possess.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;(<cite>Williams.</cite>)
</span>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Motion.</h4><p>&mdash;The power of motion in certain
species of bacteria is due to hair-like appendages
called flagella. These flagella by a lashing movement
somewhat resembling the action of oars
enable the organisms to move through fluids.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Multiplication.</h4><p>&mdash;After bacteria have fully developed,
each cell divides into two equal parts;
the process of division is called fission. Each<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of these two parts rapidly grows into a full-sized
organism. Then fission again takes place, so
that four bacteria replace the original one. In
each of the four, fission occurs again, and so
the process of multiplication continues. As
bacteria develop they group themselves in characteristic
ways. Some, like the streptococci,
arrange themselves in chains; the diplococci, in
pairs; the tetrads, in groups of four; others in
packets called sarcin√¶, and still others, the
staphylococci, form masses supposed to resemble
bunches of grapes.</p>
</div>

</span>
</div>

<p>Under favorable conditions fission occurs
rapidly; in some types a new generation may
appear as often as every 15 minutes. Enormous<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
multiplication would result if nothing occurred
to check the process. But in nature such increase
never continues unhindered, and bacteria, acting
upon their food substances, produce acids and
other materials injurious to themselves. Furthermore,
lack of proper food, moisture, or favorable
temperature, and competition with other organisms
tend to prevent their unrestricted growth
and multiplication.</p>

<span class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 5.&mdash;Bacteria with Spores.</span> (<cite>Williams.</cite>)
</span>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Spores.</h4><p>&mdash;Most bacteria die if conditions become
unfavorable to their growth, but some enter into
a resting stage. This stage is characterized by
the development of round or oval glistening bodies
called spores, which are of dense structure and
possess an extraordinary power to withstand
heat, chemicals, and unfavorable surroundings.
Except in rare instances a single cell produces
but one spore. As soon as favorable conditions
of temperature, moisture, and food supply are
restored, the spore develops into the active form
of the germ; it may, however, remain dormant<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for months or years. Spore formation, however,
occurs in only a very few varieties of pathogenic
bacteria.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Distribution.</h4><p>&mdash;Bacteria are very widely distributed
in nature; they are in fact found practically
everywhere on the surface of the earth.
They are present in plants and water and food;
on fabrics and furniture, walls and floors; and
they are found in great numbers on the skin,
hair, many mucous surfaces, and other tissues
of the body.</p>
</div>

<h3>PROTOZOA</h3>

<p>The protozoa are the lowest group of the animal
kingdom. Like bacteria they are composed of
single cells so small as to be visible only under
the microscope. They play an important part
in causing certain diseases of man, especially
in the tropics. Among the well-known human
diseases of protozoan origin are malaria, amoebic
dysentery, and sleeping-sickness. Protozoa also
cause several wide-spread and serious plagues of
domestic animals.</p>

<h3>VISIBLE PARASITES</h3>

<p>A few diseases are caused by parasites large
enough to be seen with the naked eye. One of
the most important is hookworm disease. This<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
disease is caused by a tiny worm which penetrates
the victim's skin and ultimately finds its way
into the intestine. Other diseases also are caused
by parasitic worms, such as tapeworms, pinworms,
and trichin√¶. The latter are acquired
as a result of eating infected meat, particularly
infected pork that has not been thoroughly
cooked.</p>

<h3>TRANSMISSION OF PATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS</h3>

<p>Pathogenic or disease producing organisms
need for their development food, moisture,
darkness, and warmth, conditions that exist
within the human body. When one or more
of these factors is unfavorable, development of
germs is checked; if unfavorable conditions
are extreme or long continued, the organisms
begin to die. It is difficult to say at exactly
what moment they will die if deprived of moisture
or exposed to extremes of temperature or other
unfavorable conditions, just as it would be impossible
to state at exactly what moment a
collection of house plants would all be dead if
water were withheld, or if the room temperature
were greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Most pathogenic organisms, however, do not
flourish long outside the body, and owe their<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
continued existence to a fairly direct transfer
from person to person. They gain access to the
body through mucous surfaces such as the respiratory
and digestive tracts, and through breaks
in the skin, such as cuts, abrasions, and the bites
of certain insects. They leave the body chiefly
in the nasal and mouth discharges, as in coughing,
sneezing, and spitting, in the urine and bowel
discharges, and in pus or "matter."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig6.png" width="500" height="340" alt="Flow chart depicting spread of typhoid fever." title="" />
<span class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> (<cite>L. H. Wilder.</cite>)
</span>
</div>

<p>The problem of controlling communicable
diseases, consequently, lies in preventing the
bodily discharges of one person from travelling<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
directly into the body of another. If a person
is not expelling pathogenic germs, it is clear that
he cannot pass diseases on to others. But both
pathogenic and harmless germs follow the same
routes from person to person, so that safety as well
as decency lies in preventing so far as possible
all exchanges of bodily discharges.</p>

<p>There are five routes by which the bodily discharges
most frequently travel from one person
to another. Four of these routes of infection
are called public, because in most cases efforts
of individuals alone are not sufficient to control
them. The public routes are water, milk, food,
and insects. The fifth, or private route, includes
all means by which fresh discharges of one person
are passed to another, as when nose and mouth
discharges are carried in coughing, sneezing, and
kissing, or when bowel and bladder discharges
are carried by the hands. These five routes in a
given case differ greatly in relative importance,
but the fifth, or direct route plays an immense
part, although its importance in causing sickness
has only lately been recognized. It cannot be
too strongly emphasized that the chief agent in the
spread of human diseases is man himself, and the
human hand is the great carrier of disease germs
both to and from the body. If unclean hands
could be kept away from the orifices of the body,<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
particularly the mouth, many diseases would soon
cease to exist.</p>

<h4 class="norm">Defenses of the Body</h4>

<p>In view of all the dangers from disease-producing
germs it may seem surprising that the human
race has not long ago succumbed to its invisible
enemies. But the body has various defenses by
means of which it may prevent invasion, or successfully
combat its enemies in case they do gain
access.</p>

<p>The unbroken skin is usually impassable to
bacteria. Virulent organisms are often found
upon the skin of perfectly healthy persons,
where they appear to be harmless unless an abrasion
occurs which affords entrance into the deeper
tissues. Most bacteria breathed in with the air
cling to the moist surfaces of the air-passages and
never reach the lungs.</p>

<p>Mucous membranes lining the mouth and other
cavities of the body would prove favorable sites
for the growth of bacteria if the mucus secreted
by them were not frequently removed. The
mouth of a healthy person may contain bacteria of
many kinds, but the saliva has a slight disinfectant
power and serves as a constant wash to the
membranes. The normal gastric (stomach) juice
is decidedly unfavorable to the growth of bacteria,<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
although it does not always kill them; they often
pass through the stomach and are found in large
numbers in the intestines. Other bodily secretions,
such as the tears and perspiration, tend to
discourage bacterial growth.</p>

<p>Tissues of the body vary greatly in their power
to resist invading germs, so that the route by
which germs enter influences the severity of their
effects. Typhoid bacilli and the spirilla of Asiatic
cholera when taken with food or water produce
far more serious disturbances than when injected
under the skin; infections from pus germs through
an abrasion of the skin may result in a slight local
disturbance, while the same amount introduced
into a deeper wound might cause a fatal infection.
Certain germs nourish in certain tissues only;
even tuberculosis, which attacks practically all
tissues, has its favorite locations.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Immunity.</h4><p>&mdash;In addition to its mechanical defenses
against disease, the body shows a varying
degree of <i>immunity</i>, or the power possessed by
living organisms to resist infections. Immunity
or resistance is the opposite of susceptibility. It is
exceedingly variable, being greater or less in
different people and under different conditions,
but the exact ways in which it is brought about
are still in many cases far from clear.</p></div>

<p>Immunity may be <i>natural</i> or <i>acquired</i>. By<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
natural immunity is meant an inherited characteristic
by which all individuals of a species are
immune to a certain disease. The natural immunity
of certain species of animals to the diseases of
other animals is well known. Man is immune to
many diseases of lower animals, and they in turn
are immune to many diseases of man. Cattle,
for instance, are immune to typhoid and yellow
fever, while man shows high resistance to rinderpest
and Texas fever; both, however, are susceptible
to tuberculosis, to which goats are immune.
There are all gradations of immunity within the
same species. Moreover, certain individuals
have a personal immunity against diseases to
which others of the same race or species are
susceptible.</p>

<p>Immunity may be <i>acquired</i> in several ways. It
is commonly known that one attack of certain
communicable diseases renders the individual
immune for a varying length of time, and sometimes
for life. Among these diseases are smallpox,
measles, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, infantile
paralysis, typhoid fever, chicken-pox, and mumps;
erysipelas and pneumonia on the other hand
appear to diminish resistance and to leave a
person more susceptible to later attacks.</p>

<p>Again, in some cases immunity may be artificially
acquired by introducing certain substances<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
into the body to increase its resistance. Examples
of this method include the use of antitoxin as a
protection against diphtheria, of sera in pneumonia
and other infections, and vaccination against
smallpox and typhoid fever whereby a slight form
of the disease is artificially induced. Laboratory
research goes on constantly, and doubtless many
more substances will eventually be discovered
that will reduce human misery as vaccines and
antitoxin have already reduced it.</p>

<p>Vaccination and inoculation have saved thousands
of lives. Smallpox, once more prevalent
than measles, was the scourge of Europe until
vaccination was introduced. During the 18th
century it was estimated that 60,000,000 people
died of it, and at the beginning of the 19th century
one-fifth of all children born died of smallpox
before they were 10 years old. In countries
where vaccination is not practised the disease is as
serious as ever; in Russia during the five years
from 1893-97, 275,502 persons died of smallpox,
while in Germany where vaccination is compulsory,
only 8 people died of it during the year 1897.
Death rates from diphtheria and typhoid fever
have been greatly reduced by the use of antitoxin
and antityphoid vaccine. Thus in New York
State in 1894, before antitoxin was generally used,
99 out of every 100,000 of the population died of<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
diphtheria, while only 20 out of 100,000 died of it in
1914. In 1911 a United States Army Division of
more than 12,000 men camped at San Antonio,
Texas, for four months. All of these men were
vaccinated against typhoid fever and only a
single case occurred during the summer, although
conditions of camp life always tend to spread the
disease.</p>

<p>While many and various factors tend to lower
resistance rather than to increase it, the idea that
these factors act equally in all kinds of infection is
erroneous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The principal causes which diminish resistance to
infection are: wet and cold, fatigue, insufficient or unsuitable
food, vitiated atmosphere, insufficient sleep and rest,
worry, and excesses of all kinds. The mechanism by which
these varying conditions lower our immunity must receive
our attention, for they are of the greatest importance in
preventive medicine. It is a matter of common observation
that exposure to wet and cold or sudden changes of
temperature, overwork, worry, stale air, poor food, etc.,
make us more liable to contract certain diseases. The
tuberculosis propaganda that has been spread broadcast
with such energy and good effect has taught the
value of fresh air and sunshine, good food, and rest in
increasing our resistance to this infection.</p>

<p>"There is, however, a wrong impression abroad that
because a lowering of the general vitality favors certain
diseases, such as tuberculosis, common colds, pneumonia,
septic and other infections, it plays a similar r√¥le in all<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
communicable diseases. Many infections, such as smallpox,
measles, yellow fever, tetanus, whooping-cough,
typhoid fever, cholera, plague, scarlet fever, and other
diseases, have no particular relation whatever to bodily
vigor. These diseases often strike down the young and
vigorous in the prime of life. The most robust will succumb
quickly to tuberculosis if he receives a sufficient dose
of the virulent micro-organisms. A good physical condition
does not always temper the virulence of the disease;
on the contrary, many infections run a particularly severe
course in strong and healthy subjects, and, contrariwise,
may be mild and benign in the feeble. Physical weakness,
therefore, is not necessarily synonymous with increased
susceptibility to all infections, although true for some of
them. In other words, 'general debility' lowers resistance
in a specific, rather than in a general, sense."&mdash;(Rosenau:
Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, pp. 403
and 404.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>CARRIERS</h3>

<p>Well persons who carry in their bodies pathogenic
germs but who themselves have no symptoms
of disease are called carriers. Thus typhoid
carriers have typhoid bacilli in the intestinal tract,
while they themselves show no symptoms of
typhoid fever; diphtheria carriers have bacilli of
diphtheria in the throat or nose, but have themselves
no symptoms of diphtheria, and so on. It
has now been proved that many patients harbor
bacteria for weeks, months, or even years following
an infection, and are dangerous distributors of<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
disease; also, some healthy individuals without a
history of illness harbor living bacteria which
may infect susceptible persons in the usual ways.
Transmission by healthy carriers goes far to explain
the occurrence of diseases among persons
who have apparently not been exposed. This
explanation has greatly clarified the whole problem
of the spread of communicable diseases.
Carriers, unfortunately, exist in large numbers, and
render the ultimate control of disease exceedingly
difficult. They can usually be identified by
bacteriological tests. To some extent they can be
supervised; food handlers at least should be
legally obliged to submit to physical examinations,
and should be licensed only when proved free
from communicable disease.</p>

<p>Diseases are also spread by persons suffering
from them in a form so mild or so unusual
that they pass unrecognized. These persons are
known as "missed" cases. Carriers of disease and
"missed" cases go freely about the community,
handling food, using common drinking cups, travelling
in crowded street cars, standing in crowded
shops; in various ways coming into close contact
with other people, coughing and sneezing and
kissing their friends no less often than normal
individuals. It is consequently clear that the
bodily discharges of supposedly normal persons<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
may be hardly less a menace than those of persons
known to be infected.</p>

<p>Diseases that depend for transmission upon milk,
water, food, and insects may be controlled by
public action, that is, by specific measures taken
by a large group of people in order to protect the
individual. Such action constitutes <i>public sanitation</i>.
There is, however, a large group of diseases,
chiefly sputum-borne, that cannot be controlled
except by individual action. Such individual
action constitutes a large part of <i>personal hygiene</i>.</p>

<p>The whole problem of controlling infections
sounds simple, depending as it does for the most
part upon unpolluted water, milk, and food,
extermination of certain insects, and cleanliness
in personal behaviour. In practice the problem is
not so easy. Public sanitation has performed miracles
in the past, and will do much in the future;
behaviour, however, will continue to be influenced
by many factors, social and economic as well as
personal. Ignorance of the laws of health is an
obstacle to progress, but in modern conditions
even the instructed may be unable to control
their ways of living and working. Indeed, such
control is at present limited to the privileged few.
On the ignorant and the poor, those least able to
bear it, society loads the heaviest burden of sickness.
Only when ignorance and poverty are<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
abolished, as one day they will be, can the final
stage be reached in the fight for public health.</p>

<h3>THE NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES</h3>

<p>In this group is included a great variety of
maladies. Of some the causes are known, while
in the case of others, origin, prevention, and remedy
are still obscure. Here belong defects in structure
of the body, both hereditary and acquired;
insanity and other nervous diseases; new growths,
like tumors and cancer; disturbances of bodily
processes, as malnutrition and gout; and the
important class of degenerative diseases, like
arteriosclerosis, in which tissues become hardened
and fibrous and hence less able to perform their
normal functions.</p>

<p>The degenerative diseases are playing a menacing
part in national health. The average length
of life in the United States has shown a marked
increase it is true, during the last 40 years. But
this gain represents chiefly the saving of life
through prevention of communicable diseases, especially
among babies and children; among people
who have passed the 30th year on the other hand,
death rates are actually increasing. This increase
is most marked after the age of 45, and is caused
chiefly by the increase of cancer, and of degenerative
diseases of the heart, blood vessels, and<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
kidneys. Degeneration of tissues is normally a
condition typical of old age, and in aged persons
it may occur in any tissue. There is no elixir of
youth, and for old age there is no cure. But the
important facts in this connection are that degenerative
changes now occur prematurely, and
that among a vast number of people, in various
classes of society and various occupations, the
vital organs show a marked tendency to break
down after the age of 45.</p>

<p>This condition is not inevitable. Before the
beginning of the present war, death rates at all
ages were decreasing in England, Sweden, and
other European countries. In America also
degenerative diseases can be checked or prevented
to a large extent, and it is highly important that
their causes should be generally understood.</p>

<p>The two groups following include some of
the probable causes:</p>

<p>1. Conditions of life which result in continued
overwork, and mental overwork in particular;
worry, excitement, insufficient recreation and
exercise, and other kinds of nervous strain typical
of modern life, especially in cities.</p>

<p>2. Irritating substances in the body, including
poisonous substances resulting from infectious
diseases, and from syphilis in particular; poisons
from chronic infections, alcohol, and industrial<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
poisons such as lead and other metals; overeating
and improper eating, especially of meat and other
proteins, and rich or highly seasoned food;
faulty digestion, constipation, and imperfect
elimination through the kidneys.&mdash;(See Dr. A.
E. Shipley, in bulletin of the N. Y. City Dept. of
Health, Feb., 1915.)</p>

<p>The importance of early recognition cannot
be overemphasized. In many of these troubles
the symptoms are not pronounced, and the victims
have no knowledge of their condition until
they happen to be examined for life insurance,
or until the disease is far advanced. And even
when they realize that trouble exists, as for
example constipation or overwork, most people
absolutely fail to realize how serious the consequences
may be. The first step toward remedy is
periodic complete physical examination by a
competent physician, in order to learn in time how
to prevent these degenerative diseases, if present,
from growing worse. The custom of undergoing
an annual physical examination is becoming
more common, and "such a course, conservatively
estimated, would add 5 years to the average
life of persons between 45 and 50."&mdash;(Winslow.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Recently, we have been making examinations of
the employees of whole institutions, large banks and
other industrial concerns in New York City, and we<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
find almost the same conditions there. Out of 2000
such examinations among young men and women of
an average age of 33, just in the early prime of life,
men and women supposedly picked because of their
especial fitness for work, only 3.14% were found free of
impairment or of habits of living which are obviously
leading to impairment. Of the remaining persons,
96.69% were unaware of impairment; 5.38% of the total
number examined were affected with chronic heart trouble;
13.10% with arteriosclerosis; 25.81% with high or low
blood pressure; 35.65% with sugar, casts or albumen in
the urine; 12.77% with combination of both heart and
kidney disease; 22.22% with decayed teeth or infected
gums; 16.03% with faulty vision uncorrected....
The fact of greatest import, however, was that impairment,
sufficiently serious to justify the examiner in referring
the examinee to his family physician for medical
treatment, was found in 59% of the total number of
cases, while 37.86% were on the road to impairment because
of the use of "too much alcohol," or "too much
tobacco," constipation, eye-strain, overweight, diseased
mouths, errors of diet, and so forth....</p>

<p>"And what is the cause of this appalling increase, in
the United States, of these and other degenerative diseases?
I believe it can be shown to the satisfaction of
any reasonable person that the increase is largely due to
the neglect of individual hygiene in United States....</p>

<p>"If a man were suddenly afflicted with smallpox or
typhoid fever or any other acute malady, he would lose
no time in getting expert advice and applying every
known means to save his life. But his life may be threatened
just as seriously, though possibly not so imminently,
by arteriosclerosis, heart disease, or Bright's disease,<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and he will do nothing to prevent the encroachment of
these diseases until it is too late, but will continue to eat
as he pleases, drink as he pleases, smoke as he pleases,
or overwork, and worry himself into a premature grave."&mdash;("Conservation
of Life at Middle Age," Prof. Irving
Fisher, Am. Journal of Public Health, July, 1915.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Periodic physical examinations are as necessary
for children as for adults, in order to detect
physical defects. These defects are known to
have such an immense bearing upon health that
routine examinations of all children have become
an integral part of the work of enlightened
public schools.</p>

<p>Prevention of degenerative disease, then, as well
as of the enormous numbers of preventable accidents
and injuries, depends in large measure upon
proper living conditions and proper personal
habits. The infectious diseases, according to
Dr. Hill, cost us annually at least 10 billion dollars
in addition to the loss of life, and he adds:
"The infectious diseases in general radiate from
and are kept going by women."&mdash;(Hill&mdash;New
Public Health, p. 30.) Women, it is true, can
prevent many of the infections, but they can do
still more, for hygienic habits to be effective
must be acquired early, and mothers and teachers,
because they have practically the entire control
of children, have the power to prevent many cases<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of degenerative as well as of communicable
disease.</p>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER II</span><br />
<br />
HEALTH AND THE HOME</h2>

<p>Of all the considerations that determine health,
heredity is the one unalterable factor. Although
certain characteristics are obviously hereditary,&mdash;complexion,
height, and mental and physical traits
in great variety,&mdash;yet in the past heredity has
been little understood. In consequence it has
served too often as a scape goat for faults
and failings not beyond an individual's control.
Our first clear understanding of the principles
underlying heredity resulted from experiments
made by Mendel, an Austrian monk, during the
last century, and it is now possible to predict
with a high degree of accuracy the inheritance of
certain characteristics.</p>

<p>Many diseases, formerly considered hereditary
because their actual causes were unknown, are
now known to be communicable. Thus, it is now
understood that tuberculosis is not hereditary,
although little children may be infected by
tuberculous parents. No germ diseases are inherited
in the strict sense of the word; but a<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
baby may be infected with syphilis before birth
if his father or his mother has the disease.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that certain tissue
weaknesses of the body seem to be hereditary,
and in consequence one family is more susceptible
to digestive disorders, another to diseases of the
lungs, a third to deafness, and so on. Moreover,
general low vitality may be inherited. It should
be emphasized, however, that hereditary weakness
does not inevitably lead to disease. Many persons
have succeeded in preventing the development
of active disease by guarding against strain in
directions where they are weak by inheritance.</p>

<p>Of all tissue weaknesses that may be inherited,
defects of the nervous system are the most
serious. Nervous disorders of every degree of
severity, from slight nervous instability even to
insanity, may result when these tissues are defective;
but it is now a recognized fact that nervous
disorders in many cases can be prevented from developing.
Feeblemindedness, another condition
due to defective tissue, is known to be inherited in
the majority of cases, and in all cases it is incurable.</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF ENVIRONMENT AND
PERSON</h3>

<p>By environment is meant everything outside
the body that affects it; taken in its complete<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
meaning the word might include everything that
is or ever was in the whole universe. It is possible
to consider here a few only of the many
environmental and personal factors affecting
the health of individuals.</p>

<p>The home constitutes the important part of
environment for most persons, and for children
in particular, since they spend the greater part of
their time in or about it, and get there the
foundation on which their health in later years depends.
For persons employed away from home,
industrial and occupational hygiene is hardly less
important; but those subjects are too extensive
to be considered here.</p>

<p>Most people live where they must, and few
have any part in planning the construction of
their own houses. In choosing a house, however,
one should remember that rooms where sunshine
never enters are unfit for continued occupation.
For children in particular fresh air and sunshine
are essential, and it may be economy in the end to
pay a comparatively high rent for an apartment
having sunshine during at least a part of the day.
Ignorance and carelessness, unfortunately, can
spoil the best living conditions, and sometimes
even in the country fresh air and sunshine are excluded
from sleeping and living rooms.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Ventilation.</h4><p>&mdash;Ventilation has a direct bearing<!-- Page 30 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on health, although, contrary to former belief, the
actual amount of oxygen in the air is not ordinarily
the most important factor; even badly ventilated
rooms contain more than enough oxygen to
support life. The factors of prime importance
in ventilation are temperature, humidity, air
movement, and the number of persons in a given
space since the greater the distance from one
another the less is the probability that diseases
will be spread.</p></div>

<p>Room temperature should not be above 70¬∞ F.
and, except for the aged or sick, it is better to be
between 60¬∞ and 65¬∞. Some moisture in the air
is desirable; the amount needed is from 50% to
55% of the total moisture that the air can hold at
a given temperature. We have no apparatus to
decrease humidity in the air of houses, and in
summer we are obliged to endure humidity, if excessive,
no matter how uncomfortable we may be.
But in winter the air in most houses is too dry,
so that the mucous membranes of the nose and
throat often become irritated and susceptible to
infection. Most heating systems, particularly in
small buildings, make no provision for supplying
moisture. Keeping water in open dishes on or
near radiators is often recommended, and would
greatly improve the condition of the air, if people
remembered to keep the dishes filled.</p>

<p><!-- Page 31 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The following is a simple but effective device to
increase humidity: Roll an ordinary desk blotter
into a cone about 8 inches in diameter at the base,
and keep it constantly submerged for about one
inch in a dish of water. The water rises to the
top of the blotter and a large surface for evaporation
is thus afforded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig7.png" width="200" height="161" alt="Cone made of desk blotter sitting in shallow dish of water." title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>
</span>
</div>

<p>Stagnant air is harmful. Air should be in
constant though not necessarily perceptible motion.
Air about the body, if motionless, acts like
a warm moist blanket, preventing the passage of
heat from the body.</p>

<p>The three factors, heating, humidity, and air
motion, must be considered together. Every
person requires each hour about 3000 cubic
feet of air, and the problem of heating and
ventilating is that of providing this amount in
gentle motion, at a temperature of about 65¬∞ F.,
and of humidity from 50-55%. Higher temperatures<!-- Page 32 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and stagnant air cause disinclination to
work, headache, nausea, restlessness, or sleepiness,
and if continued are likely to result in loss of
appetite, and anemia. The tuberculosis movement
has clearly shown the benefits both for
the sick and the well of living in the open air,
and has caused great and beneficial changes
within a generation. The more time spent in the
open air the better; since however most persons
who work must spend the greater part of the
day indoors, ventilation is a matter of great
importance.</p>

<p>Although fresh air enthusiasts are still too few,
yet some go to the extreme and think that because
cool air in motion is good, the colder the air
and more violent the motion the better. On the
contrary, chilling the whole body or a part of the
body lowers resistance. Draughts of air have no
bad effects upon persons in good health, particularly
those accustomed to changes in temperature.
But draughts are likely to be injurious to aged or
sick persons and babies, by diminishing their
resistance to such infections as common colds
and pneumonia. It should be remembered that
draughts or cold alone cannot cause colds; the
specific germs must be present.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Lighting.</h4><p>&mdash;Amount and direction of light are
physiologically important. Defects of the eyes,<!-- Page 33 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
too prolonged use, and insufficient light are the
commonest causes of eye strain. Most eye defects
can be relieved by glasses. Children's eyes
should be examined upon entering school, and
as often afterward as the oculist advises. Prolonged
use causes fatigue of the eyes, especially
when the illumination is poor; within limits,
the amount of light needed depends on the nature
of the work. Light should come from the left
side of right handed people; never from the front.
Light reflected from snow, sand, glazed white
paper of books, or other bright surfaces is fatiguing
from its intensity, and from the unusual angle
at which it enters the eyes. Too much light
is harmful, and probably causes some of the effects,
such as nausea and headache, commonly attributed
to poor ventilation.</p></div>

<p>Almost all blindness is preventable, and
blindness due to industrial accidents and processes
is no exception to this rule. Surely no individual
precautions or legal measures are too great in
order to guard against this saddest of all physical
defects.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Cleanliness of Houses.</h4><p>&mdash;A clean, well-cared
for house is desirable from every point of view,
but certain kinds of cleanliness affect health
more than others.</p></div>

<p>The most scrupulous care should be exercised<!-- Page 34 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wherever food is stored or prepared. The kitchen
is in reality a laboratory; in it either intelligently
or ignorantly are formed chemical compounds
which have a far-reaching effect upon family
health. From the standpoint of health no other
room in the house is so important. It
should be bright, airy, and easy to clean. In
cleaning kitchen tables and woodwork water
should not be allowed to soak into cracks and dark
corners, carrying with it particles of food for the
nourishment of bacteria and insects. Linoleum,
if used to cover the floor, should be well fitted
at the edges to prevent water from running
underneath. There should be neither cracks nor
crevices in wall or floor, and no dark corners
or out-of-the-way cupboards in which dust, food
particles, and moisture can accumulate. Such
conditions not only attract mice and roaches,
but furnish favorable soil for the development of
moulds and fungi which by their growth affect
food deleteriously. Waging a constant warfare
against the development of bacteria constitutes
a large part of good housekeeping.</p>

<p>All cooking utensils should be thoroughly
washed, scalded, and dried before they are put
away; the use of carelessly washed dishes is
bad. Enameled or agate ware which has begun
to chip should be discarded. Dish-cloths and<!-- Page 35 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
towels should be washed and boiled after using,
and if possible dried in the sun.</p>

<p>Every place in which food is kept should have
constant care. The refrigerator is particularly
important. Its linings should be water-tight, and
the drain freely open at all times; otherwise the
surrounding wood will become foul and saturated
with drainings. At least once a week it should
be entirely emptied and cleaned in the following
way: The racks should be thoroughly washed in
hot soapsuds to which a small amount of washing
soda has been added, rinsed in boiling water,
dried and placed in the sun and air. All parts of
the refrigerator should be washed in the same
manner, especially grooves and projections where
food or dirt may lodge. The drainpipe should
be flushed, the whole interior rinsed again with
plain hot water, thoroughly dried with a clean
cloth, and left to air for at least an hour. The
drainage pan should be washed and scalded
frequently. Food showing the slightest evidence
of spoiling should be removed from the refrigerator
at once.</p>

<p>Even more attention should be paid to the hands
of the cook. They should be washed always
before handling food, and always after visiting
the toilet, using the handkerchief, or otherwise
coming in contact with nose, mouth, or other<!-- Page 36 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bodily secretions. Theoretically coughing and
sneezing ought not to occur in the neighborhood
of food, especially of food to be eaten raw; and
persons with coughs, colds, or other communicable
disease, however slight, ought not to handle
food. If this rule were observed in practice,
more persons would go hungry, but fewer would
be sick.</p>

<p>Thorough cleaning of rooms involves soap,
water, sunshine, air, and elbow grease, just as it
did before germs were discovered. Cleaning
means actually removing dirt and dust, not merely
stirring it up to settle again; consequently dry
sweeping and dusting are ineffectual. Vacuum
cleaning, and sweeping and dusting with damp or
"dustless" mops and dusters are good. Deodorants
and disinfectants do not take the place of
ordinary cleanliness.</p>

<p>Dust does not carry living disease germs to an
appreciable extent; the fact is now well established
that diseases formerly thought to be transmitted
by dust or even supposed to travel directly through
the air, are carried on tiny particles of moisture
and mucus expelled in coughing and sneezing.
This mode of transmission is called droplet or
spray infection; it is one of the most active agents
in spreading certain kinds of communicable
diseases.</p>

<p><!-- Page 37 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Nevertheless dust in motion is harmful; it
irritates the lining membranes of the nose, throat,
bronchial tubes, and lungs, even causing tiny
wounds through which disease germs enter. Thus
tuberculosis is especially prevalent among stone
cutters, felt workers, and others engaged in dusty
trades. Metallic dust is especially harmful,
because it is harder and sharper than dust from
organic substances like wool and cotton. Furthermore,
presence of dust indicates a low standard
of cleanliness. People who tolerate it generally
tolerate uncleanliness in other forms, more serious
though less apparent.</p>

<p>Cleaning would not be so great a problem if
most houses were not littered with such dust
catchers as carpets, so-called ornaments, carved
and upholstered furniture, banners, draperies,
and a vast collection of articles that can only
be classified as Christmas presents. In actual
practice things that are difficult or expensive to
clean seldom are cleaned; carpets for example are
considered unhygienic, not because they cannot
be cleaned, but because they are not. William
Morris' advice to exclude from houses all articles
not known to be useful or believed to be beautiful
would, if followed, add years to the lives of housekeepers.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Garbage</h4><p>, has little bearing on health, except<!-- Page 38 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in so far as it affords a breeding place for flies. If
it contains disease germs it may be dangerous,
but statistics show that garbage handlers, although
they can hardly be called especially careful, are
not more subject to sickness than other men of
their class. Garbage disposal is chiefly a question
of preventing a public nuisance; it is a matter of
cleanliness and public decency.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Insects.</h4><p>&mdash;Flies, cockroaches, and other scavenging
insects may carry disease germs on their feet
and thus infect food on which they walk. Typhoid,
cholera, dysentery, and other diseases have
been carried by flies. Flies are always a menace,
and should not be tolerated; moreover, the
thought of their coming to food directly from
manure piles and privy vaults is disgusting.
Houses should be thoroughly screened in the
fly season, but it is better to destroy the nuisance
at its source. The chief breeding places of flies<!-- Page 39 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
are garbage cans and manure piles. If the garbage
can is water tight, closely covered, frequently
emptied, and thoroughly cleaned, flies will not
develop in it; about ten days must elapse from
the time when the egg is laid until the insect is
ready to fly. Fly traps to fit on the garbage can
are useful. Manure should be screened and
removed frequently, or it can be treated chemically.
Methods for treating it are given in "Preventive
Medicine and Hygiene."&mdash;Rosenau, p.
255, and in Bulletin No. 118, of the U. S. Dept.
of Agriculture, July 14, 1914.</p></div>

</span>
</div>

<p>Other diseases carried by insects are malaria
and yellow fever, each by a special species of
mosquito; typhus fever, by lice; and bubonic
plague, by rat fleas. Various diseases less common
in this country are carried by other insects.
Even when mosquitoes are not carrying disease
germs their bites may be harmful since they are
often rubbed, especially by children, until the
skin is broken, and various infections may enter
through the wounds. Insects of every kind,
rats, mice, and vermin should be excluded from
houses.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sewage.</h4><p>&mdash;Discharges from the bowels and
bladder contain various germs, and constitute one
of the most important routes by which germs of
typhoid fever, cholera and certain other diseases<!-- Page 40 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
travel from person to person. Keeping sewage
out of the water supply is consequently of great
importance. Where a system of sewage disposal
exists, the responsibility of making the system
adequate and thus safeguarding public health
rests upon the community as a whole. Communities
ordinarily get just as much, or just as little
typhoid fever as they are willing to endure.</p></div>

</div>

<p>In places having no system of drainage privies
must be used. They can be made harmless, as
army camps prove, but they require scrupulous<!-- Page 41 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
care. Fecal matter must be prevented from draining
into wells and other water supplies, and must
be screened from flies. The privy should be
located at a distance from the well. The minimum
distance that is safe depends in each case
upon the nature of the soil and the direction of the
natural drainage. Even when the privy is situated
below the well on sloping ground, drainage may still
occur from the privy to the well; however, a well-made,
properly located pit privy is safe unless
it is near a limestone formation. The dry earth
system is satisfactory in places having an efficient
public scavenger system; in this system pails or
cans are used to receive the discharges, which are
then covered with sand, ashes, earth or, preferably,
chloride of lime. The buckets are frequently
emptied and the contents buried at least one foot
below the surface of the ground. The objection
to this method for more extended use is that
proper care of the cans is a disagreeable duty of
which most households soon tire.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Personal Cleanliness.</h4><p>&mdash;The main functions of
the skin are three: to protect underlying tissues,
to excrete waste matter, and to regulate bodily
heat by checking or allowing the evaporation of
perspiration. After perspiration has evaporated
solid matter is left upon the skin, and oily matter
also is deposited on it by the glands that keep the<!-- Page 42 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
skin lubricated. Removing these and other
materials at least once a day is desirable to improve
the bodily tone and sense of well-being.
Real cleanliness is impossible without frequent use
of warm water and soap.</p></div>

<p>Cold baths are stimulating, though not very
efficacious for cleansing purposes. They are
valuable tonics if properly used, but delicate or
elderly persons should use them only by a physician's
advice. Chilly feelings or depression
following should be the signal for any person
to discontinue cold bathing or swimming in cold
water.</p>

<p>Warm baths are soothing in their effects, and
are appropriate at bed time, particularly for
persons inclined to sleeplessness. Very hot baths,
especially if prolonged, may be harmful, and
should not be taken often.</p>

<p>There is no clear connection between general
cleanliness and disease. Frequent bathing does
not protect a person from any particular disease,
except in so far as bathing necessarily includes
washing the hands. If typhoid germs for example
have actually been swallowed, a clean bodily
exterior is of no avail in preventing typhoid fever
or in diminishing its severity. The same is true
of other diseases.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to emphasize unduly the<!-- Page 43 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
importance of clean hands. Hands are prime
offenders in distributing fresh bodily secretions,
and germs both innocent and harmful. All
health authorities agree on this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Perhaps 90% of all infections are taken into
the body through the mouth. They reach the mouth
in water, food, fingers, dust, and upon the innumerable
objects that are sometimes placed in the mouth.
The fact that the great majority of infections are
taken by way of the mouth gives scientific direction
to personal hygiene. Sanitary habits demand that the
hands should be washed after defecation and again
before eating, and fingers should be kept away from
the mouth and nose, and that no unnecessary objects
should be mouthed. All food and drink should be clean
or thoroughly cooked. These simple precautions alone
would prevent many a case of infection."&mdash;(Rosenau:
Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, p. 366.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Dr. Chapin says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Probably the chief vehicle for the conveyance of nasal
and oral secretion from one to another is the fingers.
If one takes the trouble to watch for a short time his
neighbors, or even himself, unless he has been particularly
trained in such matters, he will be surprised to note
the number of times that the fingers go to the mouth and
the nose. Not only is the saliva made use of for a great
variety of purposes, and numberless articles are for one
reason or another placed in the mouth, but for no reason
whatever, and all unconsciously, the fingers are with
great frequency raised to the lips or the nose. Who can<!-- Page 44 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
doubt that if the salivary glands secreted indigo the fingers
would continually be stained a deep blue, and who can
doubt that if the nasal and oral secretions contain the
germs of disease these germs will be almost as constantly
found upon the fingers? All successful commerce is
reciprocal, and in this universal trade in human saliva the
fingers not only bring foreign secretions to the mouth of
their owner, but there exchanging them for his own,
distribute the latter to everything that the hand touches.
This happens not once, but scores and hundreds of times
during the day's round of the individual. The cook
spreads his saliva on the muffins and rolls, the waitress
infects the glasses and spoons, the moistened fingers
of the peddler arrange his fruit, the thumb of the milkman
is in his measure, the reader moistens the pages
of his book, the conductor his transfer tickets, the
"lady" the fingers of her glove. Every one is busily engaged
in this distribution of saliva, so that the end of
each day finds this secretion freely distributed on the doors,
window sills, furniture and playthings in the home, the
straps of trolley cars, the rails and counter and desks
of shops and public buildings, and indeed upon everything
that the hands of man touch. What avails it if the pathogens
do die quickly? A fresh supply is furnished each
day."&mdash;(Chapin: The Sources and Modes of Infection,
p. 188.)</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Oral Hygiene.</h4><p>&mdash;Cleanliness and proper care
of the mouth and teeth can hardly be over emphasized.
Their bearing upon health is direct.
Long ago it was recognized that persons with
decayed or missing teeth frequently suffered<!-- Page 45 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from dyspepsia, a natural result of inability to
masticate properly, but only within recent years
has it been realized that decayed teeth give rise
to many other diseased conditions. Bacteria are
constantly present in the mouth. If the mucus
of the mouth is not removed, it forms a sticky
coat upon the surfaces of the teeth and gums.
In this bacteria collect, and pus or matter may
also be formed, which, if carried by the blood to
other parts of the body, may cause digestive
troubles, rheumatism, and diseases of heart and
kidneys. (See Dr. T. B. Hartzell, Health News,
Oct., 1915, "The Importance of Mouth Hygiene
and How to Practise it.")</p></div>

<p>To keep the mouth and teeth healthy they must
have:</p>

<p>1. Proper use.</p>

<p>2. Proper care.</p>

<p>3. Proper treatment.</p>

<p>1. Teeth, like other parts of the body, need
exercise. Foods that require a considerable
amount of chewing should be included in the
diet. Such food is needed by children as soon
as their first teeth have come, but care must
be exercised to see that the food is actually chewed
before it is swallowed.</p>

<p>2. A good brush should be provided. The
stiffness of the bristles should be regulated according<!-- Page 46 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to the individual. The brush should
be thoroughly rinsed after using, and discarded
as soon as it is worn. Dental floss is generally
needed to remove particles that have lodged
between the teeth.</p>

<p>Brushing the teeth by passing the bristles
across them is not efficacious. They should be
brushed not across but with the cracks, as a good
housewife sweeps a floor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the light of recent investigation conducted by
some of the leading students of mouth hygiene, the
most effective way to use the toothbrush is to place the
bristles of the brush firmly against the teeth, applying
firm pressure, as though trying to force the bristles between
the teeth, using a slight rotary or scrubbing motion....
After a little practice the user of this method
will be surprised at the results obtained. Care should
be used to go over all the surfaces of the teeth in this
manner."&mdash;(See Dr. W. G. Ebersole. "The Importance
of Mouth Hygiene and How to Practice it," Health
News, Oct., 1915.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After brushing the teeth, the mouth should
be rinsed by forcing lukewarm water about the
teeth, using all the force that can be brought
to bear by the cheeks, lips, and tongue.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<p>3.</p> <h4>Treatment.</h4><p>&mdash;The teeth, including the first
teeth of children, should be inspected by a competent
dentist at least twice a year. Periodic
cleansing by a dentist, and early attention to<!-- Page 47 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
small cavities, may prevent serious ill health
and impairment of the body, as well as the acute
suffering generally accompanying treatment of
advanced dental defects.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Clothing.</h4><p>&mdash;Clothing was originally used for
purposes of ornament. Desire for protection
from cold and dampness came later. The amount
of clothing required varies greatly according to
individual needs and habits, but it is increasingly
recognized that light clothing is best, provided
that the wearer is really protected from cold.
Clothing should be porous in order to allow ventilation
of the body, supported so far as possible
from the shoulders, and clean and well aired.
Dampness favors the growth of germs which may
cause irritation of the skin.</p></div>

<p>Clothing should not constrict the body or
hamper its movements. Perhaps the worst health
menace for which clothing is to blame comes from
the high heeled shoes on which many women prefer
to limp through life. From the health standpoint
shoes are of great importance. Bad shoes
are responsible for many cases of flat feet, whose
muscles have degenerated through non-use, and
for much so-called "rheumatism," which is merely
the protest of abused muscles. Bad shoes also,
by distorting the feet, prevent comfortable walking,
which is the only out-of-door exercise readily<!-- Page 48 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
available for the vast majority of people; and
still worse, the resulting unnatural position of the
body sometimes has serious consequences by
bringing injurious strains on other muscles and
organs.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Food.</h4><p>&mdash;Two distinct problems are encountered
here: the problem of nutrition, and the problem
of preventing sickness. Nutrition, or proper
feeding, is a subject beyond the scope of this book;
it is nevertheless one of the most important, if
not the most important, factor in maintaining
health. Food preparation and care of children,
the two most important functions of the home,
are unfortunately relegated to the least intelligent
and least interested members of most households
in which servants are employed.</p></div>

<p>Most American families eat too much protein
food, such as meat and eggs. Excess of protein
probably leads to degeneration of tissues, and
plays a part in causing the degenerative diseases
already mentioned. Habit is important here as
in other ways of living, but cereals and vegetables
should in large measure make up the diet of
sedentary persons and indeed of everyone in
warm weather.</p>

<p>The amount of food required in 24 hours depends
on many factors: age, height, weight,
occupation, season, and habit. Underweight and<!-- Page 49 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
overweight are both abnormal conditions; probably
the latter is the more easily remedied.
Both require the advice of a physician. Rapid
reduction of weight involves certain dangers,
especially for persons with weak hearts.</p>

<p>Food may cause sickness either because it is
in itself harmful, or because it carries disease
germs. Meat from diseased animals should be
destroyed before it reaches the market, but bacterial
activities in food originally wholesome may
form in it poisonous substances.</p>

<p>The chief diseases known to be carried by food,
water, or milk are typhoid fever, paratyphoid,
dysentery and other diarrh≈ìal diseases, scarlet
fever, diphtheria, septic sore throat, and tuberculosis.
The sole problem here is to keep human
and animal excretions out of food, water, and milk.
Since thorough cooking kills disease germs, danger
arises chiefly from raw foods. All fruits and
vegetables eaten raw should first be thoroughly
washed.</p>

<p>Water is essential to health. At least three
pints should be taken daily, the amount varying
somewhat according to diet, exercise, temperature,
and so forth. Most persons drink too little
water.</p>

<p>Cities and towns should of course have public
supplies of pure water. Contamination of water,<!-- Page 50 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when it occurs, is caused chiefly by sewage from
cesspools, privies, and drains. All well or spring
water must be constantly watched and Boards
of Health are always ready to examine samples
of water and to report whether it is safe to drink.
At the present time a porcelain filter is the only
satisfactory kind for a household, but many
domestic filters are so badly cared for that in actual
practice they are worse than none. Danger from
a filter containing an accumulation of impurities
is greater than the danger from most ordinary
water supplies. Boiling water for ten minutes
kills all pathogenic germs, but this method is
inconvenient on a large scale and is not practical
for continued family use.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to insure a regular
supply of pure water in every house. It is not
satisfactory to have two kinds, one for drinking
and one for other purposes, since mistakes are
sure to be made, especially by children. Some
families who use only bottled or filtered water
for drinking purposes habitually run the risk involved
in using impure water from the tap for
cleaning the teeth.</p>

<p>Freezing destroys most germs, but ice is not
necessarily free from bacterial life, and should be
used in drinking water only when known to be
free from impurities. Neither does freezing milk<!-- Page 51 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
or cream necessarily kill germs that may be contained
in it.</p>

<p>Raw milk plays so important a part in the spread
of disease that its fitness for human consumption
is open to serious question. Certified milk, where
obtainable, is safe but expensive. Boiled milk is
safe, but changed in taste and to some extent in
quality. If milk is heated to 142¬∞-145¬∞ F. and
kept at that temperature for 30 minutes all disease
germs in it are killed. This process, called pasteurization,
renders milk safe. The objection is
sometimes made that continued use of pasteurized
milk for infants causes scurvy, but in New York
City where over 90 per cent. of the milk is pasteurized
no increase in scurvy has been noticed, while
a large diminution in deaths of infants from diarrh≈ìal
diseases has resulted, as in all cities where
pasteurization is required.</p>

<p>The following is a simple method for pasteurizing
a quart bottle of milk. If the directions
are exactly followed the milk will be pasteurized
at the end of the process; no thermometer need
be used. To prevent the bottle from breaking,
it is first warmed by placing it for a few minutes
in a pail of warm water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"From the results of the experiments it was concluded
that any housewife can pasteurize a one quart bottle of
milk by:</p>

<p><!-- Page 52 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
1. Boiling 2¬Ω quarts of water in a large agate saucepan;
or better</p>

<p>2. Boiling 2 quarts of water in a 10 pound tin lard pail,
placing the slightly warmed bottle from the ice chest in it,
covering with a cloth and setting in a warm place. At the
end of one hour the bottle of milk should be removed and
chilled promptly. The water must be boiled in the container
in which the pasteurization is to be done."&mdash;(Ruth
Vories, in "Health News," Sept., 1916.)</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Elimination.</h4><p>&mdash;Careful attention should be paid
to elimination through the bowels and kidneys.
Constipation is responsible for many common ailments;
among them are headache, disinclination to
work, irritable temper, and lowered resistance. If
long continued, constipation becomes serious both
from congestion and displacement of pelvic organs,
and from absorption over a considerable time of
even small amounts of the poisonous substances
resulting from decomposition of food in the large
intestine. The bowels can best be regulated by
diet, water, exercise, and habit. The habitual use
of cathartic and laxative drugs is most unwise,
because they tend to aggravate the trouble.
Moreover the habitual and continued use of injections
and "internal baths" is harmful, and
would not be considered necessary if bran and
coarse flour and vegetables were substituted for
concentrated foods. Greed, laziness, and lack of<!-- Page 53 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
intelligence lead most persons suffering with constipation
to prefer pills to the restraints demanded
by hygienic living. The habit of evacuating the
bowels at a regular time, if established in early
childhood and rigidly adhered to, will prevent constipation
among most healthy people. Any person
who thinks drugs necessary should consult a
physician, and be prepared to follow the r√©gime he
advises over a considerable period of time and at
the cost of some self-denial.</p></div>

<p>For healthy people, voiding urine presents no
difficulty if a sufficient amount of water is taken;
but some persons reduce the amount of liquid
taken in order to escape the inconvenience of urination.
This practice is harmful, and may involve
insufficient cleansing of the entire system. If
frequent urination disturbs sleep, liquids may
be withheld during the evening; but the total
amount of water taken in 24 hours should not be
diminished.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Rest and Fatigue.</h4><p>&mdash;A fatigued person is a
poisoned person. Muscular exertion burns the
fuel constituents of the body, as we recognize by
the greater heat generated within us during muscular
exertion. Waste products, resulting from
this burning process, accumulate if not removed,
and clog the body in somewhat the same way that
ashes and cinders clog a furnace. The fatigued<!-- Page 54 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
person remains fatigued, consequently, until the
accumulations of waste matter are removed by the
normal action of the lungs, skin, and kidneys.</p></div>

<p>Fatigue is caused by both mental and physical
work, and when excessive, affects the nervous
system most disastrously. The body can and
should respond to occasional extra drafts on
strength and endurance; its flexibility and power
of adjusting to varying conditions may even be
stimulated thereby. But even slight fatigue, if
continued and especially if associated with anxiety
or worry, has caused many nervous and mental
breakdowns.</p>

<p>Work carried beyond the point of normal fatigue
requires a proportionately longer time for recovery.
For example, if the point of fatigue has been
reached by a certain finger muscle after 15 contractions,
and if half an hour is required to rest it completely,
one might suppose that one hour would
rest it after 30 contractions. This is not so, however;
after 30 contractions 2 hours are required, or 4
times as much rest for twice the amount of work, if
continued beyond the point of fatigue. Laboratory
experiments and experience alike show that this
principle holds true in other forms of fatigue.
Thus the output of factories has been shown in
many instances to be greater, other things being
equal, when operatives work 8 hours a day than<!-- Page 55 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when they work longer. Excessive hours in any
kind of work are the poorest economy.</p>

<p>Fatigue is increased in direct proportion not
only to muscular exertion but also to the amount of
speed, complexity, responsibility, monotony, noise,
and confusion involved in an occupation. Ability
to bear fatigue differs greatly with different people,
as ability varies to bear other kinds of strain.
Rest at night and on Sunday, and the annual
vacation should be enough to keep a person in
good condition. If not, there is probably something
wrong with the worker's health, the nature
of his work, or his adaptation to his particular kind
of work. This statement is not only true of persons
regularly employed, but of those living at home,
including children in school, women in "society,"
and especially mothers of families.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sleep.</h4><p>&mdash;A sufficient amount of sleep is essential
to health, but individual requirements vary
widely. Each person should know and regard his
own need, and children and young people should
be obliged to go to bed early. Ability to sleep is
largely habit; good habits should be formed and
continued. Sleep-producing drugs should never
be taken, except by a doctor's prescription.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Recreation.</h4><p>&mdash;Owing to the speed, complexity,
and worry of modern life among all classes, and to
the monotony of work in industry, recreation has<!-- Page 56 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
become a matter of vital importance for everyone.
Some muscular activity, preferably in the open air,
is needed by every healthy person. Recreation
should be as unlike the regular occupation as
possible: going to the theatre, for example, is not
the best exercise for sedentary workers employed
all day in artificially lighted offices. The element
of pleasure is essential. Hoisting dumb-bells
purely from conscientious motives is seldom
beneficial, and is generally soon abandoned.</p></div>

<p>The part played by habit in matters of health is
often overlooked. Although the body adjusts
itself to widely varying conditions and even to
unfavorable ones, the importance of forming
desirable habits cannot be overemphasized.
Sudden or radical changes in living, however,
particularly among people no longer young, may
play havoc. New and violent systems of exercise,
weight reduction, and food fads forced on families
by enthusiastic discoverers involve considerable
risk.</p>

<p>Many elements enter into health; in no single
one is found hygienic salvation. Temptation
always exists to emphasize one element at the
expense of others. For instance, people who insist
upon overventilating rooms regardless of others'
comfort may themselves be utterly careless in
regard to necessary sleep, and more than one fastidiously<!-- Page 57 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
clean person has disregarded the highly
unclean condition of constipation. To maintain
sound health only a rational program will
suffice: properly balanced work and play, sleep
and food and all other elements must be included
in due proportion. And over-anxious health
seekers might well remember that health is not so
much an end in itself, as a means to a happy and
productive life; even in concern over health, it
is possible for him that saveth his life to lose it.</p>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER III</span><br />
<br />
BABIES AND THEIR CARE</h2>

<p>The principles of hygiene are fundamentally
the same for young and old. The applications,
however, differ at different ages. From the
time when physical growth and development are
complete until changes due to old age appear,
an individual commonly has greater resistance
than at other ages, and is able in consequence to
endure unfavorable conditions of life with more
success.</p>

<p>Babies, on the other hand, are exceedingly
sensitive to their environment. Surroundings
that are even slightly unfavorable are likely
to make babies sick. In order to remain healthy,
they must have exactly the right kind of food,
in the right quantities and at the right times;
their sleep, exercise, and clothing must be carefully
regulated; they must be protected from
careless handling, from nervous strain, and above
all, from the many kinds of infection to which
they are peculiarly susceptible. The life of a
baby fortunately can be controlled almost completely;<!-- Page 61 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
when properly regulated it offers, therefore,
an unequalled opportunity to see how
hygienic principles work out in actual practice.</p>

<p>The primitive mother's instinct to nourish and
protect and succor her helpless child was the
original form of nursing. Instinct alone, unfortunately,
has never accomplished much in
preserving health. The human race has now
had an experience in the care of infants that extends
over thousands of years. Yet today we
are still, on the whole, less successful in keeping
babies alive than we are in raising domestic
animals; we still allow society to continue, like a
modern Herod, in its ruthless career of slaughtering
the innocents.</p>

<p>About 14 babies out of every 100 born in the
registration area<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the United States die before
reaching the age of one year, while in some of
our industrial cities as many as 25 out of every
100 born die before they are a year old. Most
of these deaths are preventable. Thus, in a few
American cities, the death rates have been so
reduced that fewer than 10 babies out of every 100
die before completing the first year; while in
Dunedin, New Zealand, as a result of the work
of the Society for the Health of Women and
<!-- Page 62 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Children, the infant death rate has been so reduced
that in 1912 only about 4 out of every 100
babies died before they were a year old.</p>

<p>While ignorant mothers, who may or may not be
uneducated women, and contaminated milk, are
as a matter of fact, chiefly responsible for our
high infant death rates, yet as we have already
seen, every factor in the environment has its effect
upon a baby. This fact has led Sir Arthur Newsholme,
an eminent English authority, to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Infant Mortality is the most sensitive index we possess
of social welfare. If babies were well born and well
cared for, their mortality would be negligible. The
infant death rate measures the intelligence, health, and
right living of fathers and mothers, the standards of
morals and sanitation of communities and governments,
the efficiency of physicians, nurses, health officers, and
educators."</p></blockquote>

<p>Care of the child should begin at the earliest
possible moment: that is, nearly nine months before
he is born. Care before birth, for want of a
better name, is called prenatal care of the mother.
Every woman who thinks that she is pregnant
should put herself at once under the care of a competent
physician, so that he can make the necessary
examinations as early as possible. If she
follows his advice in regard to hygiene and proper
regulation of her life, she may be free from anxiety,<!-- Page 63 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and may justly expect that her delivery will be a
safe and normal process.</p>

<p>A demonstration of the value of prenatal care
was recently made by the Boston District Nursing
Association. During the year 1915 prenatal care
was given to 751 expectant mothers in 5 wards of
the city; each woman attended a pregnancy clinic,
where she was under the care of an experienced
obstetrician, and was visited at intervals by a
nurse who kept careful watch of her general condition
and gave necessary advice and encouragement.
In consequence the death rate among the
babies whose mothers had prenatal care was only
half as great, through the whole first year of life,
as the death rate of babies in the same wards
whose mothers had not had prenatal care. Moreover,
the rate of still-births was only half as great
as the rate among the general population of Boston.
If prenatal care can save so many lives, surely it
ought to be available for every pregnant woman in
the land, including even that generally neglected
class of people who are neither very rich nor
very poor.</p>

<p>Each baby's birth should be recorded by the
registrar of births, and parents should make sure
that registration has been attended to in the city
or town where they live. In some states birth
registration is already obligatory, but in any case<!-- Page 64 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it is required by the child's own interest. For
instance, in later life it may be necessary for him
to prove the date and place of birth in order to
establish, among other things, his right to vote and
to inherit property, and to settle the question of
his liability to military service. Moreover, complete
and accurate birth registration is needed by
every community because it is essential to such
reforms as reducing infant mortality and abolishing
child labor.</p>

<h3>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>Statements in regard to growth and development
are based on observations of many children. It
should be remembered that the following figures
represent averages only, and that healthy children
may vary from them considerably without giving
cause for alarm.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Average Size.</h4><p>&mdash;The average weight of a baby
at birth is from 7 to 7¬Ω lbs. and the average length
is about 20 inches, but it is not unusual for a child to
weigh anywhere from 5 to 10 pounds at birth and to
measure from 16 to 22 inches in length. During the
first week of life a baby loses slightly in weight.
After the first week a healthy baby should gain from
4 to 8 ounces a week until he is six months old; after
that time the weekly gain is less. The weight at
birth will usually double during the first five<!-- Page 65 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
months, and treble during the first year. Consequently,
a baby weighing 7 pounds at birth may
be expected to weigh 14 pounds when five months
old, and 21 pounds when a year old. Weight is
one of the most important indications of a baby's
condition. He should be weighed every week
during the first 6 months, once in two weeks during
the second 6 months, and once a month throughout
the 2nd year.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Muscular Development.</h4><p>&mdash;A baby at birth is
helpless, and during the first few months he has
little muscular control. During the third month
he ordinarily begins to lift his head, and he can
usually hold it up without support by the time he
is 3 months old; when 7 to 8 months old he sits
erect and begins to play with toys. From this
time a baby makes rapid progress; he attempts to
stand on his feet, begins to creep, and by the time
he is 14 months old he is usually able to stand
alone, or even to walk a few steps. He is usually
running about without difficulty when fifteen or
sixteen months old.</p></div>

<p>Babies should never be urged to walk or to bear
their weight on their feet. If healthy they are
generally eager to go about unaided, and like to
investigate their surroundings without assistance.
If walking is unusually delayed, a physician should
be consulted.</p>

<p><!-- Page 66 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Development of Special Senses.</h4><p>&mdash;A new-born
baby is unable to distinguish objects, but the
eyes are sensitive to light and need careful protection.
Hearing, although undeveloped at birth,
soon becomes acute; consequently the child should
stay in a quiet room. When six or eight weeks
old he notices objects, and at three months old
he welcomes his mother when he is hungry. A
month or two later he begins to distinguish between
familiar and unfamiliar faces, and to show
approval or disapproval.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Development of Speech.</h4><p>&mdash;A baby six or seven
months old begins consciously to utter sounds,
and usually can say a few unconnected words
by the time he is a year old. The average child,
however, does not begin to form sentences of
more than two or three words until he is about
two years old.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Development of Teeth.</h4><p>&mdash;The so-called milk
teeth are twenty in number; they are followed by
thirty-two permanent teeth. The two lower
front teeth (central incisors) generally appear
when a child is from five to nine months old, and
in from one to three months later the four upper
front teeth (upper incisors) appear. All the first
or milk teeth should have come through by the
time a child is two and a half years old, but wide
variations occur both in the time and order of<!-- Page 67 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
appearance and should occasion no uneasiness if
the child seems well. Unusual conditions of any
sort should be referred to the physician; it is a
great mistake to attribute all illness at this time
to teething.</p></div>

<p>The first of the permanent teeth appear when a
child is about six years old. Mothers sometimes
mistake the first permanent molars for temporary
teeth, a mistake that frequently leads to neglect
and even extraction of highly important teeth.
All but the last four molars, sometimes called
wisdom teeth, should be through by the time a
child is fifteen. The wisdom teeth may not
appear before the 20th or even the 25th year.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Normal Excretions.</h4><p>&mdash;A new-born baby should
have one or two bowel movements during the
first twenty-four hours; the first bowel movements
are sticky and almost black in color. After the
baby begins to nurse, three to four movements
a day are not unusual, and throughout infancy
and childhood as well as adult life there should
be one or two evacuations of the bowels daily.
The character of the stools is more important than
the number. While the baby is taking milk only,
the movements should be soft, yellow in color, and
nearly odorless. Change in frequency of the
movements, or appearance of undigested food or
curds of milk in the stool, should be carefully noted<!-- Page 68 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and if continued, reported to a physician; they
may be the first signs of serious digestive trouble.</p></div>

<p>The urine of an infant should be odorless and
colorless. It should be voided at least once
during the first twenty-four hours, and much
more frequently after the baby begins to nurse.
Marked diminution in the amount of urine should
be reported to a doctor.</p>

<p>Efforts should be made early to develop habits
of regularity in the evacuation of the bladder and
bowels. If taken up regularly most children
learn to use a chamber for bowel movements by
the time they are three months old. Normal
children, if properly trained, usually have no
bladder discharge during the night after they are
18 months old, and they learn even earlier to
indicate a desire to urinate during the day time.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Clothing.</h4><p>&mdash;The amount and weight of a baby's
clothing should depend upon the season; but garments
worn next to the skin, except the diaper,
should be wholly or partly of wool, the lightest
weight in summer and heavier weight in winter.
During the first few weeks a baby's abdomen
should be supported by a flannel binder about six
inches wide, applied snugly but not tightly
enough to restrict either the abdomen or chest
walls. It may be replaced later by a loosely
fitting knitted band worn for warmth only. Such<!-- Page 69 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a band is especially necessary if there is tendency
to diarrh≈ìa, but in no case should it be discarded
before the 18th month. All garments except the
diaper and first flannel binder should hang from
the shoulders, and should fit loosely but well.</p></div>

<p>Clothing for babies should be of soft materials
and should be simply made. Even the first
clothes should not be very long. The weight
of very long clothing is an unnecessary burden,
and prevents free movements of the legs. At
night an entire change of clothing should be made,
and a nightgown of warmer material substituted
for the petticoat and slip. Most children are
dressed too warmly indoors, but in low temperatures
they need to be well protected.</p>

<p>Diapers should be soft and absorbent. It may
be necessary to wash new diapers several times
before using in order to make them soft enough.
Care should be taken not to apply them too
tightly, or in such a way as to cause pressure on
the genitals. They should be changed during
the day whenever wet or soiled, and at night
when the baby is taken up to be fed. Proper
care of diapers is highly important, however
laborious. They should be well washed, boiled,
and thoroughly dried before they are used a second
time. Diapers that have been wet but not soiled
should not be dried and used again before being<!-- Page 70 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
washed. Much work can be saved if pads of
loosely woven absorbent material are used inside
the diaper to receive discharges. The pads can
be burned, but even if washed the labor is less
than washing full sized diapers. Like all other
infant's garments, diapers should be washed with
pure white soap and without starch. Waterproof
material used to cover the diaper is almost sure to
irritate the baby's skin, and is consequently harmful.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sleep.</h4><p>&mdash;During his first few weeks a normal
baby sleeps about nine-tenths of the time, and
should be left undisturbed except for necessary
care. He should sleep in a crib, bassinet or
basket protected from light and drafts; in no
circumstances should a baby sleep in the bed
with his mother or any other person. Pillows are
unnecessary for babies, and indeed for older
children, but if used they should be thin and firm.</p></div>

<p>The amount of sleep necessary gradually
diminishes, but during all the years of growth
a child needs more sleep than an adult. The
amount of sleep required daily is approximately
as follows:</p>

<table rules="none" frame="void" cellpadding="2" summary="Sleep Requirements for Babies and Children">
<tr><td>First month</td>                 <td>18 to 20 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Second to sixth month</td>        <td>16 to 18 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sixth month to one year</td>      <td>14 to 15 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>One to two years</td>             <td>13 to 14 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two to four years</td>            <td>11 to 12 hours</td></tr>
</table>

<p><!-- Page 71 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
After this time a child should sleep at least
ten hours out of the twenty-four. During the
first year a nap in the middle of the forenoon
and another in the afternoon are desirable. A
child who is inclined to sleep so long that his
nap interferes with his night's sleep, should be
waked from his nap, but at the same hour every
day. When a child is a year old, one nap during
the day is often sufficient, if he is doing well,
but the habit of taking a nap at some time during
the day should be continued through the fifth
year if possible, or even later.</p>

<p>Babies should not be rocked or otherwise coaxed
to go to sleep; they should be made comfortable
and then left alone. They learn to go to sleep
by themselves as soon as they are convinced
that sleep is expected of them, and that no unfounded
objections on their part will be regarded.
Continued inability to sleep normally usually indicates
discomfort or poor general condition, and
should be taken up with the doctor. Pacifiers and
thumb-sucking should not be allowed, since they
lead to changes in the shape of the jaw with resulting
imperfect adjustment of the teeth. Soothing syrup
and like medicines should never be given to a baby;
death or permanent injury has resulted from their
use. It is impossible to emphasize too strongly
the danger of giving them even a single time.</p>

<p><!-- Page 72 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Fresh Air.</h4><p>&mdash;All that has been said about the
importance of fresh air for adults applies with
even greater force to infants and children. During
his first month especially a baby is susceptible
to draughts; nevertheless, the room should be well
ventilated and its temperature kept between 68¬∞
and 70¬∞ F. during the day, and at about 65¬∞ F.
at night. Even in cold weather the room should
be well aired two or three times a day; the baby
should be removed to another room while the
windows are open. After the baby is three or
four months old the windows may be left open
at night provided the outside temperature does
not fall below freezing. A healthy baby two or
three weeks old may be taken out-of-doors for
a short time in mild weather; when he is three
months old he may be taken out-of-doors even
in winter on bright sunny days. The time
spent out-of-doors should be gradually increased
until the baby stays out the greater part of the
day; but he should not be exposed to storms,
wind, flying dust, dampness, extremes of temperature,
or insects. The eyes should not be
covered by veils, but they should be shielded
from the direct rays of the sun at all times.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Diet.</h4><p>&mdash;A baby, in order to thrive, must have
suitable food, given at regular intervals. During
the first few months of life no other food can<!-- Page 73 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
take the place of mother's milk. Breast-fed
babies are more robust than bottle-fed babies;
more than this, they are less likely to contract
infectious diseases or to suffer from digestive
disorders. The number of bottle-fed babies who
die every year is three times as great as the
number of breast-fed babies who die. Many
mothers do not understand the risk involved
in weaning small babies; and so every year many
little lives are lost, and lost needlessly. When
poverty forces nursing mothers to wean their
babies and seek work outside their homes, one
can only say that a society which tolerates such
a waste of infant life is indeed regardless of its
own welfare.</p></div>

<p>Special conditions, of course, may make it undesirable
for a mother to nurse her baby. No one
but the physician is competent to decide this; not
even neighbors, grandmothers, other members of
the family, or the mother herself. Where artificial
feeding must be used, it should be carefully
adapted to the individual child, and in consequence
it must be prescribed by the doctor. Patent foods,
notwithstanding the claims on their printed labels,
should be used only under his advice.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Intervals of Feeding.</h4><p>&mdash;Little milk is secreted
during the first two days after the birth of a child.
The baby should, nevertheless, be put to the<!-- Page 74 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
breast as soon as he has had his first bath, if the
mother is sufficiently rested. Always before and
after nursing the mother's nipples should be
washed in water that has been boiled. Nursing
should be repeated at intervals of six hours during
the first two days.</p></div>

healthy babies is given by Holt in "Care and
Feeding of Infants." (1917.)</p>

<p>During the period when seven feedings are given
in 24 hours the following hours will be found convenient:
6 a.m., 9 a.m., 12 m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 10
p.m. and 2 a.m. The 2 a.m. feeding is the one
omitted when the number of feedings is reduced
from seven to six. Food should be given on exact<!-- Page 75 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
schedule time; the baby if asleep should be waked
for any meal except the one due at 2 a.m.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Water.</h4><p>&mdash;Pure boiled water should be given
regularly even to a young baby. He is often satisfied
with a little warm water if he is fretful between
the hours of nursing. Water may be given
from a cup, a spoon, or a bottle; it is desirable,
however, for the baby to learn to drink from a cup
before the period of weaning begins.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Weaning.</h4><p>&mdash;Ordinarily, a baby should be fed
from the breast until he is seven months old, either
exclusively or with the exception after the second
month of one bottle-feeding in twenty-four hours.
This exception will do the baby no harm and may
be a great relief to his mother. Partial breast-feeding
should continue if possible through the
ninth month, but every baby should be entirely
weaned by the time he is one year old. It may be
necessary, if either the baby or the mother is not
thriving, to change the food before the ninth
month; but it is desirable not to make the change
in hot weather. Healthy babies, it should be
remembered, increase in weight constantly, and
steady gain in weight is the best indication that a
baby's food is suitable.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Nursing Bottles and Nipples.</h4><p>&mdash;Nursing bottles
should be of heavy glass, cylindrical in shape,
without angles or corners to make cleaning difficult.<!-- Page 76 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The number of bottles provided should be
two or three more than the number of feedings
given in 24 hours.</p></div>

<p>Short black rubber nipples which slip over the
neck of the bottles should be selected. They
should be of such a shape that they can easily be
turned inside out; a nipple turner costs little, and
is well worth the price. Nipples should be discarded
when they become soft or when the opening
grows so large that the milk runs in a stream
rather than drop by drop.</p>

<p>As soon as the baby has finished his meal, the
bottle should be removed from his mouth, rinsed
in clear hot water, and left standing filled with cold
water until a convenient time for boiling all the
bottles to be used during the next 24 hours. Sufficient
time must be allowed for the bottles to cool
thoroughly between the time when they are boiled
and the time when they are refilled. When it is
time to boil the bottles they should be placed in an
agate or other suitable kettle, covered with water,
and boiled vigorously for three minutes. A cloth
placed in the bottom of the kettle will help to
prevent the bottles from breaking. After the
bottles have been removed from the boiling water,
they should be stoppered at once, either with
rubber stoppers or plugs of sterile cotton. The
stoppers, if used, should be boiled with the<!-- Page 77 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
bottles; sterile cotton may be purchased by the
package.</p>

<p>An easy and satisfactory method to care for
rubber nipples is the following: Provide as many
nipples as the number of feedings given in 24
hours, and another, if desired, to be used in case of
accident; provide also two cups of ordinary white
enamel, each one large enough to hold all the
nipples at once. One cup should have a cover;
the other should not. To avoid mistakes it is
well to have the cups different in shape. As soon
as each feeding is finished the nipple should be
thoroughly cleansed under running water by
scrubbing it inside and out with a nipple brush.
The nipple thus cleansed is placed in the cup
without a cover. When all the nipples have been
used, cleansed, and collected in the uncovered cup,
they are transferred into the other cup; water is
added, the cup is covered and its contents are
boiled for three minutes. The nipples remain
covered in the boiled water until needed; they are
removed one by one for the successive feedings.
Care must be used in removing a nipple to take it
by the rim, not to touch other nipples during the
process and not to dip the fingers into the water.
The best way is to remove them by means of a
glass rod, which is boiled with the nipples and
kept with them in the cup when not in use. There<!-- Page 78 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are several advantages of this method of caring
for nipples: it is easy; it reduces to a minimum the
necessary handling of the nipples after boiling; and
it reduces the probability of using the wrong
nipple, since boiled nipples are always in one
kind of receptacle and used nipples in another. It
also prevents the too common practice of continuing
to keep nipples in a supposedly antiseptic
solution long after the solution has become badly
soiled.</p>

may be found in the Appendix, <a href="#Page_322">page 322</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bathing.</h4><p>&mdash;Usually the cord has separated and
the navel has entirely healed by the time a baby
is 10 days old. After this time a daily tub bath
should be given; it should be given not less than
one hour after feeding. The temperature of the
room should be from 70-72¬∞, measured by a thermometer
placed in the part of the room where the
bath is to take place. In order to avoid chilling or
tiring the baby the bath should be given quickly,
without confusion or interruption; success can be
achieved by using even a moderate amount of
foresight. Before undressing the baby everything
to be used should be collected and placed
within easy reach,&mdash;clean clothing, soft towels, 2
wash cloths, pure white soap, powder, absorbent
cotton, etc. The bath tub should last of all be<!-- Page 79 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
filled with water, and its temperature tested by
means of a bath thermometer. The temperature
of the water should be from 98¬∞ to 100¬∞. After the
baby is three months old slightly cooler water
should be splashed over his chest, back, neck, and
arms just after he is removed from the tub, and as
he grows older the temperature of his cool splash
can be reduced. Children who become accustomed
to cool water in this way take kindly to their
cold showers later.</p></div>

<p>The baby's face should be washed first and
dried carefully, while his body is still covered.
Next the head should be washed; a little soap
should be used, but it must on no account enter
the eyes. Next the entire body should be soaped
with the hand; and then the baby should be placed
gently in the bath, his head and shoulders supported
by the attendant's left hand and forearm.
Care should be taken to rinse off all the soap. The
baby should not stay in the tub more than 2 or
3 minutes; after he has been removed from the
tub he should be wrapped at once in a soft bath
towel. He should be dried gently but thoroughly
by patting with soft, warm towels rather than by
rubbing. Folds of the skin should be dried with
special care. A little powder may be applied, but
a baby who is kept both clean and dry will not
need much powder, if any. The baby should<!-- Page 80 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
next be quickly dressed, with as little turning and
moving as possible. Clothing should be drawn on
over the feet instead of over the head, and the
petticoat should be placed inside the slip so that
the two garments may go on simultaneously.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Eyes.</h4><p>&mdash;Secretion accumulating in the corners of
a baby's eyes should be removed by means of a
bit of absorbent cotton moistened in boiled water.
The secretion should be wiped away gently; a
different piece of cotton should be used for each
eye, and a piece that has been used should not be
put back into the water. Further than this,
eyes in a normal condition do not need cleansing.</p></div>

<p>Every person who handles a baby should be very
sure that her hands are clean; she should be doubly
sure before she touches his eyes, since a baby's
eyes are peculiarly susceptible to infection from
any source. More than a quarter of all totally
blind persons in the United States became blind
by infection of the eyes at birth. Blindness of the
new born can be prevented in practically all cases
if the doctor uses a preparation of silver in the
baby's eyes immediately after birth. This treatment
is effective and entirely safe.</p>

<p>If at any time the eyelids look red or swollen,
or if a drop of matter appears between the lids, the
physician should be summoned at once. Total<!-- Page 81 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
blindness may result if treatment is delayed even
a few hours.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Mouth.</h4><p>&mdash;The mouth should be rinsed after
feeding by giving the baby a teaspoonful of boiled
water. Until the teeth come it does not require
other cleansing, and attempts to clean it may injure
the delicate membranes that line it. Indeed,
except in an emergency, fingers should not be
inserted into a baby's mouth. The teeth when
they appear should be cleaned by means of a soft
tooth-brush.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Nostrils.</h4><p>&mdash;The nostrils need no cleaning other
than removal of mucus that can easily be reached
by means of a piece of cotton. If a little vaseline
is placed in the nostrils on a small piece of
absorbent cotton in the early morning, collections
of mucus will usually be softened so that
they can be removed easily at bath time.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Genital Organs.</h4><p>&mdash;The genital organs of girl
babies should be gently washed twice a day, using
absorbent cotton, and tepid water. Treatment
other than cleanliness is ordinarily unnecessary.
Vaseline may be applied if the genitals are slightly
reddened; any discharge or abnormal appearance
should be reported to the doctor. In the case of
boy babies the foreskin should be gently drawn
back twice a week after immersion in the tub;
after the parts have been gently washed with<!-- Page 82 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
absorbent cotton, it should be drawn forward
again. No force should be employed in retracting
the foreskin; the physician should be consulted
if it cannot be retracted easily.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The Development of Habits.</h4><p>&mdash;During his first
few months crying is a child's only means of expression,
and he quickly learns to make effective
use of his limited opportunities. It is important
for the mother to distinguish between crying
caused by pain, illness, or hunger, and crying
caused by temper. These cries are more or less
distinctive, but no one can be sure in every
case just what a crying baby is attempting to
express.</p></div>

<p>A cry caused by hunger is fretful and often interrupted
by sucking the thumb; it ceases when
the child is fed. A cry caused by indigestion is
similar; the child is relieved for a short time by
feeding, but soon begins to cry again. If he has
acute pain, such as earache, the cry is sharp, repeated
at frequent intervals and accompanied by
other symptoms of distress, such as restlessness,
contraction of the features, and drawing up the
legs. In serious illness the cry is usually feeble,
fairly constant except when the child is asleep, and
exaggerated by slight causes.</p>

<p>A limited amount of crying is useful exercise for
a baby, and should not distress his mother unduly.<!-- Page 83 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Moreover, crying may be merely the expression
of a wish to be taken up, to be played with, carried
about or otherwise amused, to be given a pacifier,
or to be indulged in other bad habits. If not
indulged in these ways he may cry from temper.
The cry of temper is loud and violent, accompanied
by vigorous kicking or by holding the body rigid.
Proper treatment of the baby may prevent many
months of discomfort, and spare him the formation
of his first bad habit. All other possible causes for
crying should be eliminated. If the child continues
to cry when he is warm and dry and comfortable,
"It should simply be allowed to cry it
out. This often requires an hour and in extreme
cases two or three hours. A second struggle will
seldom last more than ten or fifteen minutes and
a third will rarely be necessary" (Holt). Gas
may form in the child's stomach during prolonged
crying. It is consequently permissible to
take him up after 15 minutes, and hold him erect;
he generally expels gas at once, and immediately
experiences relief. As soon as he is relieved, he
should go back to his crib.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Exercise.</h4><p>&mdash;Exercise is essential to the development
of the body, but during the first few weeks
warmth and quiet are so important that a baby
should not be disturbed except for necessary care.
His position, however, should be changed occasion<!-- Page 84 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ally;
if he lies on the same side constantly the soft
bones of the head may become misshapen from
pressure. As the baby grows older he needs more
exercise, and he may be given an opportunity for
it by removing his outer clothing and placing him
on a bed in a warm room for a short time each day.
Unnecessary handling is not good for a baby at
any age.</p></div>

<p>After he becomes more active, he may play on a
mattress or thick blanket placed on the floor. The
blanket should be covered with a washable pad or
rubber cloth and clean sheet, and the whole should
be surrounded by a fence at least two feet high.
In such an enclosure a baby may safely be left to
play if protected from draughts and cold. Elevated
pens that can be folded when not in use are
more convenient but more expensive than the
home-made arrangement. As soon as a child
begins to run about he takes ample exercise, and
he may even need to be guarded from too great
fatigue, especially toward bedtime. Games and
play should be adapted to the age of the child and
sufficiently varied to exercise all portions of the
body; but they should not be too violent nor too
prolonged. Some supervision of children's play
is necessary, but they should be given as much
freedom as possible and allowed to develop their
own initiative.</p>

<p><!-- Page 85 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Play and Toys.</h4><p>&mdash;The desire for play does not
develop until a child is about six months old. At
this age toys that can be washed, such as those of
hard or soft rubber, should be selected. A baby
instinctively carries everything to his mouth,&mdash;first
his thumb, then playthings, and later whatever
he may find, no matter how unsuitable. For
his safety and protection this habit should be
overcome as soon as possible, and he must learn
to put nothing in his mouth except food and
drink. Relatives are nearly always tempted to
give too many and too fragile toys; they merely
teach a child to be destructive and constantly to
expect something new. Toys are the first possessions
of which a child is conscious, and through
them many desirable qualities may be developed:
neatness and order, gentleness and a feeling of
protection toward the helpless doll or Teddy bear,
and unselfishness in sharing special treasures with
playmates. Later the child may be given pets and
made responsible for their care; but animals should
not be subjected to unintentional cruelties from
small children.</p></div>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
<br />
INDICATIONS OF SICKNESS</h2>

<p>By indications of sickness we mean all evidences
of deviation from a normal physical condition.
They may be apparent only to the person in whom
they occur, or to a second person only, or to
both. These deviations, commonly called the
symptoms of sickness, are always important to
notice, whether the conditions they indicate are
serious or not.</p>

<p>Early symptoms of sickness are often slight;
hence they easily pass unnoticed. Yet a slight
trouble, easily checked in its early stages, may,
if neglected, grow into a serious or even fatal
disorder: just as a burning match, which anyone
could extinguish instantly, may kindle a fire
beyond the power of an entire city to control.</p>

<p>It is important, then, to notice even slight
symptoms of sickness, first, in order to determine
the nature of the trouble, and second, in order to
institute treatment as early as possible. It is,
however, hardly less important to observe symptoms
accurately during the entire course of an
illness. A patient's progress can be determined<!-- Page 89 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
only by careful comparison between present and
past conditions.</p>

<p>Many symptoms can be detected only by
methods requiring scientific apparatus as well
as the knowledge and skill of a physician, but
very pronounced symptoms are generally evident
to anyone. The neighbors do not need to be told
when a person has advanced tuberculosis; neither
is an expert required to see that something ails a
man with a broken leg. Furthermore less pronounced
symptoms may often be clearly seen by
any observant person, even by those not specially
trained. Accordingly it is important for every
woman who has charge of others, sick or well, to
form the habit of noticing unusual appearances of
any kind. This habit is one that most people
must take pains to acquire, because people generally
see only the things that their own experience
in life has taught them to see. An added difficulty
is the fact that when illness begins it is not a
trained observer, but the untrained sufferer or
untrained member of his family who decides
whether to send for the doctor and thus to set in
motion the machinery for treatment and cure.</p>

<p>All the training and experience of a physician
are required in order to decide what symptoms
indicate, and to prescribe proper remedies.
Diagnosis, or the process of determining the<!-- Page 90 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nature of illness from the symptoms observed, is
often exceedingly difficult; it must take into
consideration not one symptom only but the
presence or absence of a number of symptoms.
Untrained persons who attempt to make diagnoses
are frequently led astray by the fact that actual
causes of trouble may be situated far from the
places where symptoms are felt or observed. For
instance, the real cause of headache may lie in a
region far removed from the head; and so-called
heart-burn, which is caused by disordered digestion,
has nothing to do with the heart. Again,
an early symptom of tuberculosis of the hip
joint is pain under the knee; a mother is
clearly not doing the best thing when she assumes
that any pain in a joint means rheumatism, and
therefore doses her suffering child with the medicine
that "helped" his rheumatic grandfather.
No untrained person is equipped to make a diagnosis,
and still less to prescribe medicine or
treatment.</p>

<p>Symptoms, like all other forms of discomfort,
tend to trouble a patient in proportion to the
amount of attention that he gives them. Hence,
in order to avoid calling his attention to them
unnecessarily they should be observed so far as
possible without his knowledge; when it is unavoidable
for him to realize what is going on,<!-- Page 91 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
observation should be made a matter of routine,
so that his interest may not be especially excited.
For instance, everyone who has seen the routine
medical inspection of school children realizes
how little attention the children themselves give
to the process, apparently regarding it merely
as one of the many inexplicable proceedings of
grown people. On the other hand, children who
know their symptoms are over-anxiously watched
soon learn to watch themselves and to exaggerate
every little ache and pain.</p>

<p>Symptoms may be divided into two classes:
first, objective symptoms, or those that can be
noted by an observer, like cough, pulse rate, or
color of the skin; and second, the subjective
symptoms, which are apparent only to the person
affected, like pain and fatigue. The success of
any woman who cares for the sick depends to a
large extent upon her quickness and accuracy
in noticing and reporting these symptoms and
their variations. It should be remembered that
pronounced symptoms are not the only ones of
importance: even slight symptoms that continue
over an appreciable length of time may be of very
great importance. A brief description of some
important symptoms follows, in order to help
persons without technical training to describe the
symptoms as well as to observe them.</p>

<h3>OBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Temperature.</h4><p>&mdash;Bodily heat is produced by slow
burning of food materials, which goes on for the
most part in actively working muscles
and glands. Heat thus generated is
distributed by the blood to all parts of
the body, but the surface of the body
is generally cooler than the interior.
In health the body temperature varies
only a few degrees, no matter how
much the temperature of its surroundings
varies; consequently a temperature
is abnormal if it is higher or
lower than the usual temperature of a
healthy person.</p></div>

</div>

<p>The temperature is taken by means
of a clinical thermometer placed either
in the mouth, the rectum, or the armpit
(axilla).</p>

<p>To take the mouth temperature, first
wash the thermometer, using cold water
and absorbent cotton or clean soft
cloth. Next shake it until the mercury
thread registers 96¬∞ or below. It
is well before purchasing a thermometer
to see whether it can be shaken
down easily. Next place the thermometer in the<!-- Page 93 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
patient's mouth, with its bulb under his tongue;
he must then keep his lips closed until it is removed.
Leave the thermometer in his mouth for
two minutes. Then remove the thermometer,
read the temperature and record the result. Clean
the thermometer at once, using first cold water and
soap, and then alcohol, 70%.</p>

<p>The mouth temperature of a healthy person is
about 98.6¬∞ F. This statement holds true if the
person has been sitting with his mouth shut for a
little while before his temperature is taken; but a
hot bath, breathing through the mouth, eating or
drinking, and so forth may cause marked temporary
changes.</p>

<p>The temperature in the rectum generally varies
less than the temperature in the mouth unless it
is taken when the rectum contains fecal matter.
The temperature should be taken by rectum in
babies and young children, restless, drowsy, or
delirious patients, patients who cannot be trusted
to keep the thermometer under the tongue, mouth
breathers, and in any patients who have difficulty
in keeping the mouth shut. The temperature is
normally about half a degree higher in the rectum
than in the mouth.</p>

<p>In order to take a temperature by rectum, adults
generally find it more convenient to lie on the side
and prefer, if they are able, to insert and hold the<!-- Page 94 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
thermometer themselves; but the attendant should
be certain that they can do so without breaking
the thermometer. Rectal thermometers should be
lubricated with oil or vaseline before using; they
should be inserted about two inches, left in three
minutes, and cleansed in the same way as the
mouth thermometer. A thermometer used to
take rectal temperatures should never be used in
the mouth.</p>

<p>In taking the temperature of a baby place him
on his back, hold him firmly with his legs elevated,
and carefully insert the bulb of the thermometer,
well oiled, for about one inch. Keep the child
quiet, and hold the thermometer in place three
minutes. Great importance should not be attached
to a slight fever of short duration. The
temperature of a child is much more easily affected
by slight causes than that of an adult, and rectal
temperatures between 97.5¬∞ and 100.5¬∞ should
not cause anxiety unless continued.</p>

<p>Temperatures taken in the axilla are less accurate
than those taken by mouth or rectum. Consequently
the method is less often used. The
axilla should first be wiped; then the thermometer
should be inserted and held for 5 minutes by pressing
the arm tightly against the chest wall. The
temperature in the axilla is normally about half a
degree lower than in the mouth.</p>

<p><!-- Page 95 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
The temperature varies somewhat according to
the time of day. It is not unusual for the mouth
temperature of persons who are entirely healthy to
be as low as 97¬∞ in the early morning, or as high as 99¬∞
in the late afternoon, and probably most people's
temperatures vary as much as a degree during the
twenty-four hours. Even greater variations that
are not long continued have little if any significance
in people who feel well.</p>

<p>Decided variations either above or below normal
are highly important symptoms. A temperature
below 98¬∞ is called subnormal, and one above
99.5¬∞ is called fever. The number of degrees of
fever does not necessarily bear a direct relation to
the severity of an illness. Thus, it does not follow
that one person is twice as sick as another, because
his temperature is twice as many degrees above
normal. All symptoms, including variations in
temperature, must be considered in connection
with one another, and it is generally impossible to
state the significance of any one symptom taken
by itself.</p>

<p>The temperature should be taken once or twice
a day as a matter of routine in almost every form
of illness, and oftener when the patient's condition
requires it. Also it should be taken as a matter of
routine whenever there is indication of beginning
sickness; especially when there is headache, pain,<!-- Page 96 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sore throat, coated tongue, cough or cold, chill,
vomiting, diarrh≈ìa, or rash. It is not a good
plan to take one's own temperature oftener than
necessary, or indeed anyone's; certainly not a
baby's, since frequent use of the thermometer may
irritate the rectum.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Pulse.</h4><p>&mdash;Each time the heart beats, blood is
forced out from the heart into the arteries, thus
causing an expansion of the arterial walls. This
expansion, called the pulse, can be felt in some
places where arteries lie close to the surface of the
body. The character of the pulse beat and its
rate, or the number of times the beat occurs each
minute, give information about the heart and
blood vessels; taken together they are perhaps
more important than any other one symptom.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="photo" src="images/fig11.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.&mdash;Taking the pulse at the wrist. Note the position of arm.</span> (<cite>From
&quot;Elementary Nursing Procedures,&quot; California State Board of Health.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>The pulse rate varies much more than the temperature.
It differs in different individuals and at
different ages, and it often shows great temporary
changes, especially during exercise or eating, or as
a result of excitement, fear, or other emotion.
Definite statements in regard to normal pulse
rates are hard to make, because different individuals
though in perfect health show marked variations;
we generally say, however, that the pulse
rate of a normal man at rest is about 72 a minute,
and that of a normal woman is about 80 a minute.
At birth the pulse is quickest; it may then be<!-- Page 97 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from 124 to 144. From the 6th to the 12th month
it may be from 105 to 115 a minute, and from 90
to 105 between the 2d and 6th years. About<!-- Page 98 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the time of puberty it reaches the adult rate, and
during old age it may be decidedly slower than
the adult rate.</p>

<p>What we chiefly want to know about the pulse is</p>

<p>1. Its rate, or number of beats per minute,</p>

<p>2. Its force,&mdash;whether weak or strong,</p>

<p>3. Its rhythm,&mdash;whether regular or irregular.</p>

<p>Much practice is necessary before the pulse rate
can be counted with any degree of accuracy, and
wide experience with both normal and abnormal
pulses is required in order to judge its strength,
rhythm, or other characteristics.</p>

<p>The pulse may be felt most conveniently on the
thumb side of the front of the wrist. The pulse
should be counted while the patient is lying down,
and the watch used must have a second hand.
To count the pulse, one should place two or three
fingers (not the thumb) on the patient's wrist, and
after the pulse has been felt distinctly for a few
beats, the exact time by the second hand of the
watch should be noticed and the counting begun
immediately. It is generally best to count for
half a minute, multiply the result by two to
get the rate for a whole minute, and then to
repeat for another half minute. The two results
should agree within two beats, if the patient is
quiet. A greater variation than two beats may
mean that the pulse rate is varying, but when it is<!-- Page 99 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
counted by inexperienced persons the apparent
difference is generally the result of inaccurate
counting, and it may be necessary to count two or
three times more. The force of the pulse varies
also in different individuals; it is, however, important
to notice when it grows stronger or weaker in
the same person. Normally the pulse-beat is
regular like the ticking of a clock; it is called irregular
if a few rapid or slow beats are followed by
others of a different rate. During sickness the
pulse should be counted whenever the temperature
is taken, or oftener; and the result should
be written down at once. The pulse of a sick
person often shows changes both in rate and
character; these changes are generally important
and should be noticed.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Respiration.</h4><p>&mdash;Variations in the rate and character
of respiration or breathing should be noticed.
The normal rate of respiration for an adult at
rest is 16 to 20 each minute, but it may be much
faster, especially during muscular exercise. In
babies the rate is about 30 to 35 a minute, and 20
to 25 in little children. The respirations, especially
of babies, can best be counted during sleep
by placing the hand lightly on the chest or abdomen.
Since the respiration rate is partly under a
person's control, it is almost sure to alter if the
patient knows it is being counted; hence when the<!-- Page 100 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
patient is awake it is better to keep one's fingers
on his wrist, to place his hand upon his chest, and
then to count the rise and fall of the chest while
apparently counting the pulse. Sometimes it is
possible to count the respirations merely by watching
the rise and fall of the nightgown or bed
clothes. The respiration is usually counted for
a full minute. A watch with a second hand must
be used, and the result should be recorded
immediately.</p></div>

<p>In certain forms of sickness breathing may become
rapid, especially if the lungs or air passages
are affected. In addition to the rate anything
unusual about the breathing should be noticed
whether it seems difficult or painful; if noisy,
whether the sound is like snoring, or wheezing,
or sighing, and so on.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>General Appearance.</h4><p>&mdash;Any unusual expression
of the face should be noted; whether it is drawn,
pinched, anxious, excited, or dull and stupid;
and also, whether the face is thin, swollen, or
puffy under the eyes. The condition and appearance
of the skin are significant: the skin may be
dry, moist and clammy, hot or cold; its color, and
the color of the face especially, may be flushed or
pale or slightly yellow or blue. A bluish tinge
about the nose, tips of the fingers, or the feet
should be specially noticed. Reddened or discolored<!-- Page 101 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
areas on any part of the body may be
important, and also eruptions, rashes, swellings,
or sores. It should be noticed whether the
abdomen is normal or whether it is distended and
hard.</p></div>

<p>Strength or weakness is indicated to some extent
by the way the patient moves, and by his ability
to walk, stand, sit, hold up his head, feed himself,
or turn in bed without assistance. The position
he habitually takes is sometimes significant;
in heart affections, for instance, he may be unable
to lie down, in pleurisy he ordinarily lies on the
affected side, and during abdominal pain he generally
draws the knees up.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Special Senses.</h4><p>&mdash;The special senses are frequently
disturbed in sickness. The eyes may be
blood-shot; the patient may be over-sensitive
to light, or see spots floating before the eyes, or he
may be unable to see at all. The pupils of the
eyes may be unusually large or small, or one may
be large while the other is small. Swelling, redness,
or discharge from the eyes should be noticed.
Hearing and touch and smell may be impaired;
or they may be abnormally acute, and cause real
suffering. Taste may be impaired, especially
when the nose is affected or when the mouth is not
clean. Discharge from the nose or ears should be
reported. Not only discharge, but also trouble of<!-- Page 102 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
any kind, such as pain, tenderness, or swelling, is
important if situated in or near the ears.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The voice</h4>&nbsp;<p>is often much altered in sickness. It
may be weak, hoarse, or whispered. Speech may
be clear or thick, or the ability to speak may be
entirely lost; in extreme weakness speaking is
generally difficult, and may be impossible. Moaning,
groaning, and other unusual sounds should be
noted. A loud, sharp cry at night with or without
waking, if a repeated occurrence, may be an early
symptom of some diseases of children.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The tongue</h4>&nbsp;<p>in health is red and moist; when
extended it is somewhat pointed and can be held
steadily. In sickness it may be cracked, dry and
parched, or if the patient is not properly cared for,
it may be covered with white, yellow, or brown
coating; in many exhausting illnesses it is flabby
and trembling. In scarlet fever the tongue is
often a vivid red color, and is then called strawberry
tongue. The odor of the breath may be
foul from decay or neglect of the teeth, from indigestion,
constipation, nasal catarrh, or special
diseases.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The throat</h4>&nbsp;<p>and tonsils are sometimes red and
swollen as in simple sore throat; or they may be
covered by white patches.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The gums</h4>&nbsp;<p>may be swollen, tender, or bleeding.
A collection of sticky brownish material may<!-- Page 103 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
appear on the teeth and gums of neglected
patients.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Cough</h4>&nbsp;<p>when present may be: dry, or accompanied
by expectoration; painful, frequent, loud,
or whooping; and worse by day or by night. The
sputum may be yellow, white, gray, rusty, blood-streaked,
dark, or frothy. The amount of sputum
should be noticed as well as its appearance.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Appetite</h4>&nbsp;<p>or absence of appetite should be noted,
and also the amount of food actually eaten by a
patient; the amount eaten is frequently not the
same as the amount carried to him on a tray.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<p>If</p>&nbsp;<h4>vomiting</h4>&nbsp;<p>occurs, the color, consistency,
amount, and general appearance of the vomitus
should be noted; if its appearance is unusual
the vomitus should be saved for the doctor's
inspection.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Excretions.</h4><p>&mdash;The number of bowel movements
is important, and also their character. The
consistency of the feces may be hard, soft or
fluid; their color may be any shade of brown,
yellow or green, from black to clay color.
They should be saved for the doctor to see if
appearance or odor is unusual.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The urine</h4>&nbsp;<p>in health is clear, amber colored,
and slightly acid. From 30 to 50 ounces should
be excreted in 24 hours; the amount varies,
however, especially according to the amount of<!-- Page 104 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fluid taken. It is important to notice whether
the urine is scanty or greatly increased in amount,
dark or pale, clear or cloudy, and whether sediment
is deposited after standing. It is essential
that urine should be voided in sufficient amount;
the necessity for watching its quantity is frequently
overlooked in the home care of the sick.
Frequency of urination should also be noted.
Inability to urinate, particularly where the urine
has previously been scanty, is serious if continued;
it should be reported to the doctor without
delay. Inability to control the bladder and bowels
are also symptoms to be reported.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Loss of weight</h4>&nbsp;<p>is significant in both adults and
children, and failure of babies and children to
gain in weight is a danger signal.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sleep.</h4><p>&mdash;The number of hours a patient sleeps
should be noticed and recorded as accurately
as possible. The word of the patient on this
subject is not sufficient evidence. Character of
sleep should also be noted, whether it is quiet
or restless, and whether the patient sleeps lightly
or is difficult to arouse.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Mental Conditions.</h4><p>&mdash;It is important to watch
carefully the mental condition of a patient;
whether, for example, he is normal, or depressed,
irritable, restless, apathetic, dull, excited, wandering,
delirious, or unconscious. Hasty judgment<!-- Page 105 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of mental conditions should be avoided, but
close attention to them is necessary.</p></div>

<h3>SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Pain</h4>&nbsp;<p>is the most important subjective symptom
and should never be disregarded. Bodily pain
does not occur in persons who are in all regards
physically and mentally well; hence pain is a
sign that something, small or great, is out of
order.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Of all symptoms pain is the one which interests
patients the most. We here emphasize the truth, too
little understood, that pain is an unpleasant sensation,
nothing more, and is <em>never</em> imagined. Imagination may
be its cause, but the pain thus produced hurts just as
truly as pain produced by a real disease. Pain is only a
phenomenon of consciousness; it is always real, even that
felt in a dream. If the patient is too unconscious to feel
it, there simply is no pain, no matter how badly the person's
body is injured." (Emerson: Essentials of Medicine,
p. 356.)</p></blockquote>

<p>One should remember that no possible method
exists to measure the intensity of pain exactly,
or to describe its quality accurately. Therefore
in describing pain, it is best to use the patient's
own language. Four points should especially be
observed, (1) its location; (2) its character, which
may be dull or sharp, stabbing, throbbing or<!-- Page 106 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
continuous, slight or severe; (3) the time at
which it is worst; certain diseases, for instance,
are characterized by more severe pain at night;
(4) it should be noticed whether the pain is relieved
or increased by change of position, eating
or drinking, heat or cold, or the like. Pain may
be felt in a part far from the place where the
trouble really lies; thus a dislocated shoulder
causes pain in the elbow.</p>

<p>Pain is always a danger signal, although the
significance is not always so great as the sufferer
thinks. The more attention a patient gives to his
pain, the more severe it always becomes, therefore
his attention should not be called to it unnecessarily.
A good observer, however, can get much
information by noticing the patient's expression,
position, motions, etc., without constantly asking
him how he feels. Although many persons overestimate
pain, others persistently disregard it,
either because they are unwilling to take the
necessary measures to remedy it, or because they
wish to appear heroic. Both courses of action are
mistaken; everyone should realize the folly and
danger of bearing pain if it is possible to remove
the cause.</p>

<p>Nausea, fatigue and malaise are other subjective
symptoms; malaise is the name given to a
general feeling of physical discomfort not restricted<!-- Page 107 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to any one part of the body. All three
are abnormal when there is not apparent or
sufficient cause.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Records.</h4><p>&mdash;An accurate record should be kept
of the patient's symptoms, medicine, diet, treatment,
etc., so that the doctor may have a continuous
record, and so that another person taking
charge temporarily may know just what has been
done for the patient. The record must be written;
otherwise details cannot be remembered exactly.
It should be as simple and concise as possible;
it is the place for facts, not for opinions, and if
inaccurate it is worse than none. It is better
not to keep the record in the patient's room,
for the patient should not see his own record,
nor hear its contents discussed. The doctor
usually writes his orders on the record sheet
itself, or on a separate sheet to be attached to
the record for reference. Blank record forms
can be purchased, but a form that is made at
home is entirely satisfactory. An example of a
daily record sheet follows.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Tuberculosis, Cancer, and Mental Illness.</h4><p>&mdash;As
we have seen, early symptoms of sickness
are always important; yet it seems worth while
to mention particularly the early symptoms of
tuberculosis, cancer, and mental disorders, because
each of these diseases, though curable in many<!-- Page 109 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
cases when taken in the early stages, is serious
and often fatal if neglected. Certain facts relating
to their cause and prevention should be known to
everyone. Tuberculosis, long our greatest cause
of death, is gradually growing less; but cancer and
mental disease are now on the increase.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Tuberculosis.</h4><p>&mdash;Every year tuberculosis causes
the death of about 150,000 people in the United
States. It is caused by the bacillus tuberculosis, a
germ which may attack any tissue of the body,
although it most frequently affects the lungs of
grown people, and the bones and glands of
children. The disease is not inherited, but
susceptibility to it appears to be; it is readily
communicated from person to person. The germ
of tuberculosis is so widely distributed that probably
few persons over 30 years of age have not been
infected with it at some time, although the infection
may have been too slight to be noticed.
Indeed, most people have probably been infected
many times, though without serious results.</p></div>

<p>Tuberculosis is spread chiefly in two ways:
(1) through any bodily discharges from infected
persons, especially through the nose and mouth
discharges; (2) through milk from infected cows.
The ways by which the disease is spread indicate
methods of prevention. Milk, especially
for children, should either be pasteurized or<!-- Page 110 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
should come from cows that have been tested
and proved to be free from the disease. Other
methods of prevention include avoiding any
and all bodily discharges of infected persons,
and increasing bodily resistance as far as possible.
Good food, sufficient rest and fresh air are not
only important preventives, but also the most
efficacious means of cure. Persons who suffer
from insufficient food, exposure, bad housing,
long hours, and bad conditions of work are especially
susceptible to tuberculosis, and thus it is
rightly called a disease of poverty.</p>

<p>Early symptoms of tuberculosis include cough,
hoarseness, loss of appetite, pain in the side, loss
of weight, getting tired easily, feeling run down,
rise in temperature in the afternoon, night sweats,
expectoration, and spitting blood. No one, nor
even several, of these symptoms necessarily
indicates the presence of tuberculosis; on the
other hand, even the cough is not necessarily
present when tuberculosis actually exists. When
one or more of these symptoms appears and continues,
a thorough examination should be made
by a doctor; examination can do no harm, certainly,
if tuberculosis is not found, and if it is,
immediate treatment is of the greatest importance.
No known drug or medicine is a cure for tuberculosis.
Successful treatment depends on taking<!-- Page 111 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the disease in time and in following the doctor's
advice unremittingly.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Cancer.</h4><p>&mdash;The cause of cancer is not known.
All the evidence, however, goes to show that it is
neither communicable nor hereditary. Cancer
may occur on the skin, stomach, or other organs;
in women it most commonly occurs in the breast
or uterus (womb). In both sexes it occurs most
frequently after 40 years of age. No known
medicine will cure cancer; salves and ointments
have no effect. Radium and <i>x</i>-ray should not be
relied upon if the cancer can be removed by operation.
Safety consists in removing the growth
entirely, and complete removal is possible only
in the early stages.</p></div>

<p>Early diagnosis is consequently of the greatest
possible importance, and an examination can do
no harm in any case. Warts and moles on the
skin may develop into cancer, and should be
removed if they show signs of irritation. Loss
of appetite and weight, any disturbance of the
stomach or intestines, and sores that refuse to
heal should lead a person to consult a physician;
the same is true of any lump in the breast, and
of irregular or persistent bleeding from the
uterus in women over forty. The fact that pain
is not present in cancer until the late stages leads
many persons to neglect the trouble until it is<!-- Page 112 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
too far advanced for operation. Time is all-important;
hope depends on operation in the
early stages when there is a very great probability
of permanent cure.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Mental Illness.</h4><p>&mdash;Insanity, like cancer, is increasing.
Like both cancer and tuberculosis, hope
lies in prevention and early treatment; and like
them both, in its early symptoms it is too often
unrecognized or neglected.</p></div>

<p>Many people are surprised to learn that known,
avoidable causes are responsible for the condition
of about 50% of the insane patients now
under treatment. Chief among these known
causes is a communicable germ disease called
syphilis, to which is due the disease called paresis,
or "softening of the brain." About 25% of
patients admitted to hospitals for the insane are
there from the effects of habitual use of alcohol,
even in "moderate" quantities. Other cases
of insanity result from diseases of the heart,
arteries, and kidneys, and still others have been
traced to the poisons of tuberculosis, typhoid,
diphtheria, and other communicable diseases.
Prevention of insanity caused by these diseases
depends upon prevention or complete cure of the
diseases themselves.</p>

<p>Still other causes of insanity are known. Hereditary
nervous weakness may predispose to insanity,<!-- Page 113 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and for such persons, those whose nervous
resistance is naturally not very great, the stress
of living may prove too much. Mental breakdowns
are rarely caused by overwork unless accompanied
by worry or bad hygienic conditions,
but they result not infrequently from bad mental
habits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The average person, little realizes the danger of brooding
over slights, injuries, disappointments, or misfortunes,
or of an unnatural attitude towards his fellowmen, shown
by unusual sensitiveness or marked suspicion. Yet all
these unwholesome and painful trains of thought, may if
persisted in and unrelieved by healthy interests and
activities, tend towards insanity. Wholesome work relieved
by periods of rest and simple pleasures and an
interest in the affairs of others, are important preventives
of unwholesome ways of thinking. We should train ourselves
not to brood, but to honestly face personal
difficulties."&mdash;(Why Should Anyone Go Insane?, by Folks
and Ellwood.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Prevention of insanity consequently depends
chiefly upon avoiding alcohol and communicable
diseases, especially syphilis; upon good hygiene,
self-control, and avoidance of bad mental habits;
and upon adopting a program of living and working
that will not overtax one's nervous strength.
Sleeplessness, unusual nervous fatigue following
slight exertion, and diminished power to control
the emotions, are among the danger signals. And<!-- Page 114 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
when a person becomes unusually depressed or
morose, excited or irritable, suspicious, unreasonable,
or "queer," it is probable that expert medical
advice should be obtained as quickly as possible.</p>

"Yesterday, October 10th, Johnny came home from
school about half past three, and said he was too cold to
play outdoors. He lay down and slept till about five,
when he vomited a large amount of undigested food. I
took his temperature and found that it was 103.8¬∞, pulse
126, and respiration 28. At 10 that night his temperature
was 102.5¬∞, pulse 116, and respiration the same as before.
The next morning at 8 he had a temperature of 100.6¬∞,
pulse 114, respiration 24. At noon his temperature was
101¬∞, pulse 118, respiration 24; and at 4 o'clock his temperature
was 100.6¬∞, pulse 122, respiration 22. The doctor
came at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon; according to his
orders I put Johnny to bed, gave him half a tablespoonful
of castor oil at 6.30, and a special gargle. His throat was
red and sore and he seemed to feel very miserable. The
doctor took a culture from the child's throat. At 8.15
and again at 8.50 he had fluid bowel movements. At
9.30 he had a glass of milk, after which he slept until 6
a.m. when his bowels moved again and urine was passed.
He passed eight ounces of urine at noon and four ounces
at 3.30. He drank a glass of water at 6 this morning, and
at 6.30 I gave him a cup of hot broth. At 8 he had a glass
of milk, but at 10 he refused everything but a glass of
water. At 1.30 he had a large dish of ice cream. He had
a cool sponge bath last night at 9, and a cleansing bath
this morning at 8.45. This morning his throat was still
sore but not so red, and I saw that he gargled every half
hour when he was awake. This afternoon he seems
brighter and asked for his harmonica, so his throat is
probably more comfortable."</p></li>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER V</span><br />
<br />
EQUIPMENT AND CARE OF THE
SICK ROOM</h2>

<p>Adequate care of the sick consists to a large
extent in rendering their physical and mental
surroundings as favorable as possible. Obviously,
a sick person, since his strength is already depleted,
needs not only to have his resistance increased
in all possible ways, but also to have all
his remaining strength conserved by eliminating
every unnecessary tax upon it. In sickness even
slight fatigue, chill, or nervous strain, insufficient
ventilation, or improper feeding, may become
factors of immense importance. Nothing is
trivial if it affects the welfare and comfort of a
patient.</p>

<p>Even when perfect provision for the care of the
sick is out of the question, every effort should be
made to insure as satisfactory arrangements as possible.
Ideal conditions are seldom found except in
buildings originally planned for the sick; yet in
many houses a few simple changes will produce
excellent results. Of course, it is not necessary<!-- Page 118 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in every case to adopt all the following suggestions.
Common sense must be the guide. For
instance, in illness that is slight and likely to be of
short duration, a patient may be more distressed
than benefited by radical changes in his surroundings.
Except when certain essentials are concerned,
great consideration should be given to a
patient's preferences; yet on the other hand it is
not reasonable to make an entire family miserable
in order to gratify some slight whim.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Choice of a Sick Room.</h4><p>&mdash;A south or east exposure
is generally best for a sick room. A south
room may be undesirable in very hot weather,
but sunshine during a part of the day is essential.
The room should be quiet, near the bath room,
and well removed from odors from the kitchen.
It should be situated so that good ventilation is
possible. It is desirable though not necessary
for it to have more than one window; in summer
the windows must be thoroughly screened. It
should be possible to open the window without
exposing the patient to a direct current of air,
and to open the door without placing him in full
view of all who pass through the hall.</p></div>

<p>It is essential for the patient to have a room to
himself. Unless he needs care or help or watching
at night, not even the person caring for him
should sleep in the room. Neither should the<!-- Page 119 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
rest of the family keep their possessions in the sick
room. Closets opening into the room, bureaus,
and chiffoniers should be emptied of the belongings
of other members of the family, to prevent
people from tiptoeing into the sick room at all
hours to remove garments. The sick room should
for the time belong exclusively to the patient,
and resulting inconvenience should be borne by
well members of the family.</p>

<p>Every possible precaution should be taken to
exclude from a sick room unnecessary noises of all
kinds; flapping curtains, squeaky doors and rocking
chairs, heels without rubber, creaking corsets,
noisy petticoats, ticking clocks, refractory bureau
drawers, and rustling newspapers are among the
everyday sounds that irritate the nerves of sick
and well alike. Ordinary out-of-door noises do
not usually disturb the sick, except when the
country patient is brought to the city, or the
reverse; but nearby and generally avoidable noise
is the kind that distracts and harasses nervous
patients.</p>

<p>Whispering is an annoying sound and should
not be allowed, either in the patient's room or just
outside the door. Whatever the subject of conversation
may be, the patient thinks that he is
under discussion. Anything undesirable for him
to hear should be settled well out of his hearing,<!-- Page 120 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and in speaking to him there is no possible objection
to an ordinary well modulated voice.</p>

<p>Usually a person's own room is more restful and
less disturbing than a strange place, but if it serves
as a work room as well as a bed room, it may easily
be the worst place during sickness. The sight of
a desk piled high with papers or a basket overflowing
with accumulations of family mending may
actually delay recovery; even the room itself may
constantly suggest work, and work necessarily left
undone. The essential thing to remember is that
mental rest is no less important than physical,
and every effort should be made to secure them
both.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Furnishing.</h4><p>&mdash;Superfluous articles add to the
care of a sick room, and in consequence they
should be removed at the outset. All the furnishings
that remain should be easy to clean, but
it is not necessary for a sick room to look bare and
desolate.</p></div>

<p>The woodwork as in any other room should
have a hard finish, and angles and corners that
harbor dust should be as few as possible. Hard
wood floors without cracks are best from the point
of view of cleanliness and convenience. A few
light, washable rugs make the best floor covering,
but very small rugs on highly polished floors slide
easily and are decidedly dangerous. Carpets<!-- Page 121 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
diminish noise, but are objectionable from every
other point of view.</p>

<p>In furnishing houses people ought to realize
more frequently than they do how greatly nervous
fatigue may be increased by ill chosen wall coverings.
Plain papers or tinted walls are best
for bed rooms and the color should not be harsh or
striking; soft gray, green, or buff is good. The
design is no less important than the color; a design
that on casual inspection appears quite harmless
may become an instrument of torture to a person
unable to escape from it for a single hour. Weak
or nervous patients sometimes become quite exhausted
from attempting to follow an intricate
pattern, or from counting over and over a design
that is frequently repeated on the wall. If the
patient sees grotesque faces and figures in the
design the paper is more objectionable still.</p>

<p>Necessary furniture includes the bed, which will
be discussed in detail later, a small table to stand
by the head of the bed, a dresser, two chairs, and a
wall thermometer. If the patient is able to sit up
three chairs are needed, of which one should be an
armchair with a high back. No rocking chair
should be allowed in the room unless the patient
himself prefers to sit in one; no one else should be
allowed to rock in the room, since the motion is
almost always annoying to patients. Elaborate,<!-- Page 122 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
carved, or upholstered furniture is unsuitable in
a sick room, but if it must be used it should have
washable covers.</p>

<p>Other desirable articles of furniture are a couch,
screen, foot-stool and a second, larger table. In
few cases, if any, is anything further really necessary,
although patients frequently desire special
articles to which there can be no objection.</p>

<p>Most ornaments add much work and little
beauty, and have no place in a sick-room. No
heavy unwashable curtains or hangings should be
allowed, but simple washable curtains and clean
white covers for the tables and dresser are desirable.
Pictures, if suitable, give much pleasure, but
must be used with discretion. It goes without
saying that the subjects should be pleasant, but
not everyone realizes that complicated subjects
are undesirable and that pictures of people or
things in motion should be avoided; patients are
sometimes worried to see motion that is forever
incomplete.</p>

<p>Flowers give great pleasure to the sick by adding
color and variety and interest to their surroundings.
They should be carefully tended and given
fresh water daily. Fading flowers and forlorn
plants should be removed from the sick room, and
those having strong, heavy odors should not even
be admitted. They do not need to be very many<!-- Page 123 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
or very expensive; indeed, a potted plant or a few
cut flowers are often more acceptable than the
great masses of costly flowers that are daily
brought to the private wards of hospitals.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Ventilation.</h4><p>&mdash;A patient needs fresh air certainly
as much as a well person, and probably even more.
His room should be thoroughly ventilated night
and day. A fireplace makes the problem easier,
but in most cases an open window is the main
dependence. It should be possible to open windows
at the top as well as at the bottom, and the
patient may be protected from a direct draught
by a screen, or by a sheet stretched along the
side of the bed and fastened at the head and foot
by tying it around the posts.</p></div>

<p>Ventilating a room without subjecting the patient
to draughts is not always easy. One method is to
insert a board three or four inches high under the
lower sash so that air is admitted between the two
sashes. Another way to ventilate without causing
a draught is to remove one or two panes of
glass and tack cheese cloth over the opening; or
to tack cheese cloth to the lower edge of the upper
window casing and to the upper edge of the upper
sash, after the sash has been lowered about a foot.
Once or twice a day the room should be thoroughly
aired by opening windows and doors until the air
has been completely changed. The patient,<!-- Page 124 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
including his head, must be well-covered during
the process. An electric fan is useful in summer,
but it should not be close enough to the bed for
the patient to feel air blowing upon him.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Heating.</h4><p>&mdash;Great care should be taken to maintain
a suitable temperature in the sick-room, and
for this purpose a thermometer in the room is a
necessity. Between 65¬∞ and 68¬∞ is generally the
best temperature, and hot water bags and extra
covers may be given if the patient is chilly. During
a bath or other treatment in which the patient
is more or less exposed the temperature should be
70¬∞. The temperature at night may be lower;
how low will depend largely on the patient's
condition and on what must be done for him
during the night. Hot water, steam heat, or
electricity is best for the sick room. Gas or oil
stoves should never be used except in emergencies,
and then for a short time only.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Lighting.</h4><p>&mdash;Sunlight is one of the most powerful
disinfectants, and for this reason if for no other
it is needed in every sick room. Sunless rooms,
moreover, even if they were wholesome, are too
depressing to a patient's spirits for use except
perhaps in hot summer days. Ordinary well-regulated
light is best in a sick room, and except in a
few diseases, especially those in which the eyes are
affected, it is undesirable to darken the room or to<!-- Page 125 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
encourage in any way an appearance of gloom.
The patient's eyes, however, should be protected
from bright lights shining directly upon them;
in this connection it is well to remember that
lights and their reflections strike differently upon
the eyes of a person lying down from the way
in which they strike the eyes of persons sitting or
standing, and a light that seems agreeable to the
attendant may therefore be painful to the patient.</p></div>

<p>Almost all persons sleep best in dark rooms, and
in most cases it is undesirable for a sick room to be
lighted at night. The attendant, however, must
be able to see what she is doing and generally
needs a shaded candle, small night light, or electric
flash. It should be possible to see the patient
clearly in case of need, otherwise serious changes
in his condition occurring in the night may pass
unnoticed.</p>

<p>A reading lamp on the bedside table is desirable
for patients allowed to read, but reading in bed
even with a well-regulated light is fatiguing, and
should not be continued for long uninterrupted
periods. A pocket flash light is safer than matches
and a candle for patients who wish to consult their
watches in the night; indeed, matches in the hands
of patients always involve risk. Some patients
find twilight a time of great depression. In such
a case it had best be shortened by drawing the<!-- Page 126 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shades early, turning on the lights, and remembering
not to leave him alone.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Cleaning.</h4><p>&mdash;The sick-room should be kept thoroughly
clean at all times, and the less dust stirred
up in doing so the better. Dry sweeping or
dusting should not be allowed. Ordinary brooms
should be dampened or covered with damp cloths,
and dust cloths should be dampened also; but
dustless mops and dusters are still better. Vacuum
cleaning is very desirable; the noise, which is its
only disadvantage, is not a serious objection in
most cases. The cleaning of rooms after a communicable
disease will be considered later.</p></div>

<p>A sick room must be kept tidy as well as
clean. The effect of order is quieting, but it
should be maintained whether the effect upon the
patient is apparent or not. Food and medicine
should not be kept in the sick-room, and all used
dishes, tumblers, soiled linen, etc., should be
removed at once. Unnecessary articles should
not be found in the room at any time; every necessary
article should be kept in its place, and its
place should be a good one.</p>

<p>Maintaining order in the room does not mean
that patients should be made uncomfortable. All
patients, especially old people, want certain possessions
within reach, and their wishes should be
considered in spite of the fact that the √¶sthetic<!-- Page 127 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
effect is generally far from good. For instance, a
perfectly smooth bed is undesirable if in order to
make it smooth the patient must be tucked in so
tightly that he is uncomfortable. And it would be
a mistake to remove an old man's newspapers
before he has read them, even if he persists in
strewing them all over the floor.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The Attendant.</h4><p>&mdash;One person and one person
only should carry the entire responsibility for the
patient. She should plan for him as well as care
for him, should see the doctor and take the doctor's
orders. Confusion and innumerable mistakes
result when several members of the family
attempt to do the talking and directing.</p></div>

<p>The attendant should wear washable dresses
with sleeves that can be rolled up, washable aprons,
and shoes with rubber heels. All her clothing
should be comfortable. She should be neat in
appearance, scrupulously clean in person, and
should keep her finger nails short and smooth.
Jewelry, especially rings and chains that rattle,
and finery of any sort are all out of place in a sick-room.</p>

<p>The attendant must learn that her own sleep,
her diet, and her out-of-door exercise are essential
to the patient's well-being hardly less than to her
own. An amateur nurse often considers that going
without food and sleep is a proof of her devotion.<!-- Page 128 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
In a passion of self-sacrifice she neglects herself
utterly for the first few days, and as a consequence
is quite useless at a later period when her services
may be most needed. An exhausted, sleepy nurse,
trained or untrained, is wholly unfit to be trusted
with medicines and doctor's orders, to note changes
in the patient's condition, or to give him kindly
attention. Efficiency and fatigue have never
pulled together since the world began, and no one
can do good work when suffering from lack of sleep
and rest.</p>

<p>The person, then, who genuinely wishes to give
her patient the best possible care should not make
a martyr of herself. She should go out of doors
daily; both fresh air and occasional absence from
the patient are essential to her physical and mental
well-being. Moreover, she will be showing her
patient the greatest kindness in the long run if
during her recreation time she thinks of him as
little as possible. Indeed, she need not consider
herself inhuman if she has a thoroughly good time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a person who is responsible
for the care of a patient must be made to realize
that she and she only is ultimately responsible
during the entire 24 hours of every day. Being
responsible for a patient does not mean that she
should be with him every minute, or do everything
herself: it does mean that she should plan so effectively<!-- Page 129 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that everything necessary is done, either
by herself or by another competent person. When
she goes away for even half an hour, she should
appoint someone else to be responsible in her
place and to her when she comes back. She must
consequently make very clear just what she wants
done. If there is medicine, nourishment, or
treatment to be given, she can easily make a list,
with the time for each, and ask that each item be
crossed off the list as soon as the work has been
done. She should not forget to ask for the list
when she returns.</p>

<p>What is really needed is a little executive ability.
As Florence Nightingale said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is impossible in a book to teach a person in charge of
the sick how to <em>manage</em>, as it is to teach her how to nurse.
Circumstances must vary with each different case. But
it is possible to press upon her to think for herself. Now
what does happen during my absence? I am obliged to
be away on Tuesday. But fresh air, or punctuality is not
less important to my patient on Tuesday than it was on
Monday. Or: At 10 p.m. I am never with my patient;
but quiet is of no less consequence to him at 10 than it was
at 5 minutes to 10. Curious as it may seem, this very
obvious consideration occurs comparatively to few, or,
if it does occur, it is only to cause the devoted friend or
nurse to be absent fewer hours, or even fewer minutes from

hour shall be for her patient without the essentials of her
nursing."&mdash;(Notes on Nursing.)</p></blockquote>

It is exceedingly difficult to care for members
of one's own family or to be cared for by them.
Too much or too little is almost invariably expected
by one person or the other, and where
great affection is involved not only is the strain increased
on both sides, but often harm results from
too great unselfishness on either side or both.
But sometimes the reverse is true, and then one
should remember that normal behavior may be
impossible for the sick. During weakness and
pain, irritability and unreasonableness are as
characteristic as other symptoms, and it is as
foolish to demand a normal mental state from a
sick person as it would be to demand a normal
temperature. For a cheerful, reasonable, and unselfish
patient&mdash;and there are surprisingly many&mdash;one
should be devoutly thankful, but patience
and pity should be given no less to those whose
tortured nerves cause suffering to others as well
as to themselves.</p>

<p>Every woman who cares for the sick should
remember that she is the patient's chief if not
his only link with the normal world, and that
his plight is pitiful indeed if she is complaining or
irritable or unwilling. Anyone who cares for the
sick should remember also that she is necessarily
in a most intimate relation with the patient,
and that such enforced intimacy calls for<!-- Page 131 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
extra consideration on her part, and for the most
scrupulous respect for confidential matters. It
is inexcusable even for members of the patient's
family to discuss with one another the patient's
private concerns, or his queer or unreasonable or
annoying ways. During sickness the skeletons
in most people's mental closets walk forth, and
anyone who misuses special opportunities to know
intimate affairs can only be classed with eavesdroppers
and village gossips.</p>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
<br />
BEDS AND BEDMAKING</h2>

<p>The common saying that the best bed for an
invalid is his own bed contains an element of
truth. Taking from a patient his own accustomed
bed, even when a better is substituted, sometimes
disturbs him greatly and makes him feel that he
is indeed very ill. Nevertheless, a suitable bed
is essential to the proper care of a helpless person,
and no patient should continue to use an unsuitable
one, unless his illness is slight and also
likely to be of very short duration.</p>

<p>Besides being comfortable, a bed suitable for
the sick must be clean and easy to keep in a
sanitary condition. The springs should be firm,
and the mattress should be elastic and should
give an even support without lumps and hollows.
The bed covers should be clean, light, and warm;
the pillows should be sufficient in number not
only to make the head and shoulders comfortable,
but also any other part of the body in need of
support. Moreover, the bed should be so placed
and of such a kind that the work of caring for<!-- Page 133 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the patient may be rendered as easy for the
attendant as possible. In every household at
least one bed suitable for a sick person should
be available in case of need.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bedsteads.</h4><p>&mdash;Beds of white enameled iron,
brass, or brass and iron combined are most
easily kept clean, and are the best in every way.
The frame should be strong enough to stand
firmly, yet not so heavy that it is hard to move.
It should have as few angles as possible, and all
its joints should be smooth and well finished.
The springs should be made of wire stretched
tightly on a metal frame that fits smoothly into
the head and foot pieces. Large castors should
be used; they may be removed from the foot
if the bed moves too easily.</p></div>

<p>A bed to be used in sickness should have the
following dimensions&mdash;length, 6 ft. 6 in., height
24 to 26 inches, width, 36 inches. If a bed is
either too high or too low the labor of lifting and
moving the patient is greatly increased. If the
bed is too narrow the patient is insecure. If the
bed is too wide, its center is difficult or impossible
to reach without leaning or kneeling upon it;
and if too short, it will prove uncomfortable
for a tall person. A bed that is too low may be
raised on four heavy boxes of the same height;
or still better, upon heavy wooden blocks which<!-- Page 134 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
any carpenter can easily make, and which are
well worth a little trouble to obtain. In the top
of each block a hollow should be made into which
the leg of the bed will fit after the castor has
been removed. A broad firm stool or a low
chair may be provided for a patient who has
difficulty in getting in and out of a high bed.</p>

<p>Beds with complicated attachments for moving
patients are not recommended for family use.
They are expensive, likely to get out of order,
seldom needed, and generally unsatisfactory. In
some surgical cases a bed with a firm, flat surface
is necessary. Such a surface may be secured by
placing between the mattress and springs two
boards slightly separated, or one wide board
with holes bored in it to afford ventilation.</p>

<p>Wooden beds are undesirable: they are difficult
to keep clean, they readily absorb moisture and
odors, they cannot well be disinfected, and their
solid frames prevent a free circulation of air.
Moreover, it is almost impossible to render fit for
use again a wooden bed into which vermin have
once made their way. Folding beds and lounges
even of the best type are unhygienic, usually too
low for the patient's comfort, and often insecure.</p>

<p>A bedstead should be wiped frequently with a
damp cloth; if it is of enameled iron it may be
washed with soap and water. The springs may<!-- Page 135 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
be cleansed with a stiff brush dipped in kerosene
oil. Excessive use of water upon the springs
is likely to make them rust.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Mattresses.</h4><p>&mdash;Various substances are used in
the manufacture of mattresses, but nothing
has yet been found that is as satisfactory as
curled hair. It is light and clean and elastic, it
does not readily absorb odors, and it is easily
renovated. Although hair is more costly than
other materials, a hair mattress may be used
almost indefinitely if it is occasionally made
over.</p></div>

<p>Felt or cotton mattresses are firm, but heavy,
difficult to keep clean, and likely to absorb odors. A
useful mattress made from straw is sometimes
found in country districts. Such a bed is
thoroughly hygienic, for the worn straw may be
burned and the tick washed and refilled with
clean straw; but straw beds are generally hard
and lumpy. The least desirable of all mattresses
is the old fashioned feather bed, and it should
never be used if a better can by any possibility
be obtained; but a feather bed should not be
arbitrarily taken away from an old person accustomed
to its use, unless his welfare is really
at stake.</p>

<p>A mattress made in two sections is unnecessary
for a single bed; indeed, a mattress made in one<!-- Page 136 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
piece is more easily kept in place if the patient
is restless. A good quality of blue and white
ticking makes a serviceable cover for both mattress
and pillows since its color is not likely to run.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of the Mattress.</h4><p>&mdash;A mattress should be
brushed frequently with a whisk broom, especially
around the tufts and edges. If a patient is long
confined to bed, a fresh one should occasionally
be substituted so that the regular mattress may
be removed, well brushed, beaten with a carpet
beater, and left exposed to the sun and air for a
day or two. A mattress that is badly soiled
should be sent to a cleaner and made over; it
cannot be cleaned properly at home. It is generally
possible to remove blood stains, if they have
not soaked through the ticking, by applying a
thick cream made from raw starch and cold water.
When the starch becomes dry it should be brushed
away, and the application should be repeated until
the stain has disappeared. For the best results
the starch should be applied before the stain is
dry.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Pillows.</h4><p>&mdash;One patient can use an almost unlimited
number of feather pillows. Some should
be soft and others firm, some large and some small;
but pillows that are very large and thick are less
useful than a greater number of smaller ones. It
is well to have several small pillows of varying<!-- Page 137 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
size and thickness to support different parts of
the body.</p></div>

<p>Hair pillows are often acceptable in warm
weather, and they are also desirable for patients
with high fever or excessive perspiration. Rubber
air pillows are a convenience in traveling and add
much to the comfort of a patient when he first
goes out in a carriage or motor car, but air pillows
are not sufficiently durable for general use.</p>

<p>If a pillow tick becomes soiled, the feathers may
be transferred to a clean tick by making an opening
about six inches long in the end of each pillow,
sewing the ticks together, and then shaking the
feathers from one tick to the other. The soiled
tick can then be washed. If the feathers themselves
have become soiled they should be renovated
by a cleaner. Pillows, like mattresses, should
be frequently brushed, sunned, and aired. They
should not be held in the mouth while a clean
pillow-case is adjusted.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Protection of the Mattress and Pillows.</h4><p>&mdash;In all
cases of sickness the mattress must be adequately
protected. Neglect is inexcusable and may cause
expense and trouble as well as discomfort to the
patient.</p></div>

<p>The following may be used to protect the
mattress or pillows: large quilted pads, small pads
of cotton batting covered with old muslin or cheese<!-- Page 138 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
cloth, slip covers for the mattress, rubber sheets
and pillow-cases, old blankets and quilts that may
be washed easily. Heavy wrapping paper, builders'
paper, and newspapers serve well in emergencies,
or for a short time.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Rubber Sheets and Pillow-cases.</h4><p>&mdash;Soft rubber
cloth, single or double faced, is most frequently
used when it is necessary to protect the bed from
discharges. It may be purchased by the yard.
Rubber sheets should not be used unless they are
really necessary. They are hot and uncomfortable,
and increase the tendency to perspire.
When used, a rubber sheet should be 1 yard wide
or wide enough to reach from the lower edge of the
pillows down to the patient's knees, and long
enough so that it can be tucked in securely on
both sides of the bed. Rubber sheets may be
cleaned by laying them on a flat surface and washing
on both sides with soap and water, using a
small brush if necessary. After rinsing they
should be wiped, and when thoroughly dry they
should be rolled rather than folded, to prevent the
rubber from breaking.</p></div>

<p>Rubber pillow-cases are used for a patient who
perspires profusely, or who has a discharge of any
kind from the head or neck, and also when substances
which may wet or stain the pillow are
applied to the head. They should be put on next<!-- Page 139 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to the pillow, securely fastened with tapes, snap
hooks, or buttons, and covered with the regular
pillow slip.</p>

<p>Rubber sheets and pillow-cases are not durable.
They should be used carefully, and frequently
examined for holes or worn places by holding them
up to the light. Even a pin hole near the center
may render a rubber sheet or pillow-case as useless
as a sieve.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sheets.</h4><p>&mdash;Sheets of ample proportions are necessary
for comfort, and important for sanitary
reasons as well. For a bed of the dimensions
mentioned in this lesson sheets should be three
yards long, and two yards wide. A safe rule for
any bed is to have the sheets one yard longer and
one yard wider than the mattress. A sheet of
these dimensions is large enough to be tucked
under the sides and foot of the mattress, while at
least twelve inches are left to fold over the blankets
at the top. Cotton sheets are as good as
linen for general use, or even better, and are far
less expensive.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Draw sheets</h4>&nbsp;<p>are used to cover rubber sheets,
and to protect beds when the rubbers are not used.
In hospitals special draw sheets are usually provided,
but an ordinary sheet folded answers every
purpose. New and expensive sheets should not
be used for draw sheets, since they are more<!-- Page 140 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
likely than other sheets to become stained. Draw
sheets should be wide enough to extend about
four inches beyond the rubber sheet at the top and
bottom.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Pillow Covers.</h4><p>&mdash;Pillow covers are generally
made of cotton, but persons who can afford the
cost frequently prefer linen, especially in hot
weather. Unless fastened with buttons or tapes,
a pillow case should be several inches longer than
its pillow. It should be wide enough to slip on
easily, but not so wide that it wrinkles or allows the
pillow to turn. If it is too small the pillow will become
hard and uncomfortable. These small things,
unimportant as they are to the well, may cause
much discomfort to a restless or nervous patient.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Blankets.</h4><p>&mdash;All wool blankets are both light and
warm, and are consequently the most comfortable
bed covering. But unless they can be dry cleaned
frequently, it is better to select blankets made
from one part wool and two parts cotton. Blankets
containing equal parts of wool and cotton are
warmer, but are more injured by washing. Very
light blankets of wool or outing flannel are useful
in summer. Double blankets should always be
cut in two and bound at the ends, since single
blankets are easier than double blankets to
handle and wash. Patients are frequently too
warmly covered by day. Too much warmth<!-- Page 141 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is enervating, it causes the patient to perspire,
and makes him restless and more susceptible to
draughts and to changes of temperature. Two
light blankets are warmer and more comfortable
than one heavy blanket.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Comforters and Quilts.</h4><p>&mdash;Heavy cotton comforters
are burdensome without being correspondingly
warm. Eiderdown quilts or those
padded with wool are good for a patient who sleeps
out of doors, or whose room is kept at a low temperature.
Bed covers that cannot be laundered
readily should be protected by basting on both
sides of the top a wide piece of muslin or linen,
which can be removed and washed.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Counterpanes.</h4><p>&mdash;White dimity counterpanes are
desirable, since they are light in weight, easily
laundered, and inexpensive. A heavy counterpane
is uncomfortable at any time, and still more
uncomfortable in sickness. If a light spread is
not available, a sheet makes a good substitute.
A counterpane should be wide enough to cover
the sheets and blankets at the sides when the bed
is open, and long enough to protect the bedding
at the top and bottom.</p></div>

<h3>BED MAKING</h3>

<p>All methods of making beds for the sick are
based upon a few underlying principles. The<!-- Page 142 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
aim in every case is to obtain the following results
with the least expenditure of time and labor:
first, to secure comfort for the patient, and to
eliminate all causes of friction, irritation, or pressure<!-- Page 143 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
upon his skin; next to keep the covers firmly
in place, so that the bed will not easily become
disarranged; then to protect the mattress, and
last, to secure as good an appearance as possible.</p>

Nursing Procedures," California State Board of Health.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To Make an Unoccupied Bed</h4><p>, proceed as
follows: remove the pillows and covers one at a
time, and place them on chairs, near an open
window if possible. Brush the mattress and then
set it up on its ends to air, or turn it back over the
foot board. Wipe the bedstead with a damp cloth.
Replace the mattress after it has aired, turning it
from side to side and from end to end on alternate
days. Cover the mattress, unless it is enclosed
in a slip cover, with a white quilted pad or an
old blanket, and then spread the lower sheet over
the mattress, so that the middle fold of the sheet
lies upon the center of the mattress in a straight
line from the head of the bed to the foot. Tuck
the sheet under, first at the top and then at the
bottom, drawing it so that it is firm and tight.
If the sheet is of proper length tuck fourteen or
sixteen inches under at the top, but take care to
cover the mattress at the foot also. Next tuck the
sheet under at the side, folding its corners to
make a neat finish like an envelope. Place the
rubber sheet, if it must be used, across the bed,
with its upper edge where the lower edge of the
pillows will come. A draw sheet somewhat wider<!-- Page 144 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
than the rubber sheet is needed next; an ordinary
sheet, folded once the long way of the sheet,
may be used, with the fold toward the head of the
bed. Tuck both rubber and draw sheet securely
under the mattress at the side. In some cases
the rubber sheet may be placed next to the
mattress, and covered by the mattress pad and
lower sheet. Place the draw sheet as directed,
whether the rubber is used or not. After the
lower, rubber, and draw sheets have been adjusted
on one side of the bed, go to the opposite side,
draw them over smoothly, and tuck them under
the mattress as tightly as possible.</p></div>

<p>Next spread the upper sheet over the bed so
that its upper edge reaches to the upper edge of
the mattress, and its middle crease lies over the
middle line of the mattress, and place it right side
down, so that the smooth side of the hem will be
uppermost when the sheet is turned over the
blankets. Place the blankets so that their upper
edges lie a little higher than the place where the
lower edge of the pillow will come, and tuck
them in firmly at the bottom and sides. If the
blankets are not long enough to tuck in at the
foot, place the lower blanket as directed and
the upper blanket five or six inches lower than
the first. When tucked in, the upper blanket
holds the lower one in place fairly well. Place<!-- Page 145 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the counterpane evenly and smoothly, tuck it
under at the foot, turn its corners neatly, turn its
upper edge under the upper edge of the blankets
and fold the upper sheet down over the whole.<!-- Page 146 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Last of all, shake the pillows and place them neatly
on the bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="photo" src="images/fig13.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.&mdash;The Closed Bed.</span> (<cite>From "Elementary Nursing Procedures," California
State Board of Health.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>Practice is necessary before it is possible to make
a bed quickly and well, and a certain amount of
proficiency in making an unoccupied bed should
be acquired before undertaking to make a bed with
a patient in it. One should learn to work in an
orderly way, without confusion, unnecessary motion,
or jarring of the bed.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To Change a Patient's Pillows.</h4><p>&mdash;Stand preferably
on the right side of the bed and slip the left
arm under the patient's shoulders, supporting his
head in the hollow of the arm. Raise him slightly
and remove the pillows one at a time with the right
hand, drawing them outward on the left side of the
bed. Place a small pillow under his head. Shake
the pillows, change the cases if necessary, and
replace them on the left side of the bed, ready to be
drawn back into position. Raise the patient as
before, remove the small pillow and draw the
others into place. It is sometimes better to hold
the patient on the upper pillow while removing and
replacing the under one.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Lifting a Patient in Bed.</h4><p>&mdash;Patients tend to slip
down toward the foot of the bed, and they should
be raised if unable to help themselves. To raise
the patient, instruct him to flex his knees and to
press his feet firmly upon the bed; place one arm<!-- Page 147 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
under his shoulders, as when changing pillows,
the other arm under the thighs, and lift him upward
without jerking. The lifting can be done
more easily by two people, and with less discomfort
to the patient: if he is entirely helpless two people
are necessary. Two people should proceed as
follows: Let <i>A</i> place her left arm under the
patient's head and shoulders as before, her right
arm under the small of his back; let <i>B</i> place her
right arm also under the small of his back and her
left arm under his thighs, and at a signal let them
lift together. In this way the weight is so evenly
distributed that a heavy person can be lifted
without great difficulty.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To Turn a Patient in Bed.</h4><p>&mdash;A patient may be
turned toward or away from you. In turning a
patient toward you, place one hand over his farther
shoulder and the other over his hip, and turn
him toward you. Then flex his knees slightly.
To turn a patient from you, pass one hand as far
as possible under the shoulders, and the other as
far as possible under the thighs. Then raising the
patient slightly, draw him back toward you,
turning him at the same time, and then flex the
knees. Lastly place a pillow firmly against his
back to support it.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To change the sheets while the patient is in
bed</h4>&nbsp;<p>proceed as follows: First collect the fresh<!-- Page 148 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
linen and place it conveniently near the bed. Then
draw the bedclothes from beneath the mattress,
raising the mattress meanwhile with one hand to
prevent jarring the bed. Remove first the spread
and then the upper blanket if there are two, fold
each once and place it on a chair. Hold the remaining
blanket in place with one hand, while with the
other you draw the upper sheet out from under it;
then fold the edges of the blanket up over the
patient to keep them out of the way. The upper
sheet, unless soiled, may be folded once and used
again as a draw sheet. Next remove all the pillows,
unless the patient prefers to keep one. Then
move the patient toward one side of the bed and
turn him on his side so that he faces the edge
nearest him. Roll the draw sheet and rubber
sheet together if both are to be removed, or
separately if the rubber sheet is to remain on the
bed; then roll the bottom sheet throughout its
entire length, and bring the three sheets, all rolled
as flat and as tightly as possible, close to the
patient's back. Pleat about half of the fresh
lower sheet lengthwise and place the pleated portion
as close as possible to the rolled soiled sheets.
Tuck in the other half of the fresh sheet at the top,
bottom and side, draw the rubber sheet if it is to
be replaced back over the fresh lower sheet,
arrange the fresh draw sheet in place, tuck it in at
<!-- Page 149 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<!-- Page 150 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"><br />[150]</a></span>
the side, and roll its free portion close to the
patient's back. The fresh side of the bed is then
ready for the patient. Lift his feet back over the
rolled sheets keeping his knees flexed, then turn
him back over the rolled sheets on to the fresh
smooth part, remove the soiled sheets and arrange
the fresh ones in place on the side where the
patient has just been lying. Be careful to keep
him well covered with the blanket. After the
lower sheets are in place and firmly tucked in,
spread above the blanket the fresh upper sheet,
and over the sheet spread the second blanket.
Hold the sheet and blanket in place with one hand
while using the other hand to draw out the first
blanket from beneath the sheet. In this way the
patient is constantly covered by a blanket. Place
the blanket just removed above the other and finish
the bed according to the directions given for an unoccupied
bed, using special care, however not to
draw the covers too tightly over the patient's feet.</p></div>

<h4>To Move a Patient from One Bed to Another.</h4><p>&mdash;On
the fresh bed have the lower sheets in place

close together side by side, and draw one mattress

Loosen the draw sheet under the patient, roll it
on both sides close to the body and draw him
gently over by means of this sheet, moving his

in height, use firm pillows or folded blankets
to make an inclined plane.</p></div>

</div>

<p>If the beds differ greatly in height and indeed
in most cases, it is better to carry the patient
from one bed to the other. At least two people
are needed; one alone should never attempt to
carry anyone heavier than a small child. One
method for lifting is as follows: Let two bearers,
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> stand on the same side of the bed.
If the patient is to be moved into the right side
of the fresh bed let both bearers stand on the
right side of the occupied bed; if he is to go into
the left side of the fresh bed, let them both stand
on the left side of the occupied bed. Let <i>A</i> place
one arm under the patient's shoulders and her
other under the small of his back, while <i>B</i> places
one arm under his hips and the other just below
his knees. Draw the patient to the edge of the
bed, instruct him to place his arms about the shoulders
of <i>A</i> and to hold the body rigid, and then
lift together at a given signal, keeping his weight
well up on the chests of the bearers.</p>

<p>Whenever a patient must be turned, lifted,
carried, or moved in any way, let him know
beforehand just what you intend to do so that
he may not be startled, and also that he may
co√∂perate if possible. Grasp him firmly but<!-- Page 153 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
gently, avoid pinching the skin, and move him
steadily and smoothly, avoiding jerks and false
starts. Do not attempt alone more than your
strength is amply sufficient to accomplish, and
endeavor at all times to handle the sick with
the utmost gentleness and consideration.</p>

<br />
BATHS AND BATHING</h2>

<p>Bathing is necessary in sickness no less than
in health. It stimulates and equalizes the circulation,
is soothing in feverish conditions, is
refreshing to most people, and by affording a
certain amount of exercise it lessens the fatigue
of lying in bed. Moreover, without frequent
bathing it is impossible to keep the skin in good
condition, since scales of dead skin, oily matter,
and solid substances left by perspiration collect
on the surface of the body when a person is
lying still in bed as well as when he is leading
an active life. The common belief that sick
people are likely to catch cold from bathing is
quite unfounded; every patient, unless his condition
is such that the doctor orders otherwise,
should have one complete cleansing bath each day.
In addition to the regular cleansing bath other
kinds are often prescribed as medical treatment.</p>

<h3>CLEANSING BATHS</h3>

<p>A <i>tub bath</i> if allowed by a patient's condition,
is the most satisfactory kind, but special precautions<!-- Page 155 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
must be taken to guard her from fatigue
and chill. The bath room and everything to be
used should be made ready before she leaves her
bed. Necessary clothing and toilet articles should
be collected and arranged conveniently, a chair
covered with a blanket and also a bath mat should
be placed beside the tub, and the temperature
of the bath room should be regulated so that it
is about 70¬∞ F., or a little lower if the room is
likely to become overheated as the bath proceeds.
The bath water should be drawn last. Its temperature,
tested by a thermometer, should be
between 96¬∞ and 100¬∞ at the beginning, and may
be increased if desirable.</p>

<p>If the patient is weak, wash and dry her face,
neck, and ears, and if necessary cut the finger and
toe nails before she leaves the bed, in any case
before she enters the tub. As soon as the patient
has left the bed, strip it and leave it to air; then
assist her into the bath room and help her carefully
into the tub. Do not allow her to stay in the
water more than ten minutes at most, and stop
the bath at once if she shows the slightest sign of
faintness, dizziness, exhaustion, difficult breathing,
marked change of color, or other unusual
symptom. Indeed, if the patient is weak or her
reaction to the bath uncertain, as when she takes
her first tub bath after an illness, someone should<!-- Page 156 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
always be within call to help the attendant in
case of need. A faint, heavy patient in a
bath tub is an impossible load for one person to
handle.</p>

<p>While the patient is in the tub, soap her well,
brush her finger and toe nails, rinse, and rub her to
stimulate the circulation. Then help her from the
tub, seat her in the chair, draw the blanket closely
about her from neck to feet, dry her with warm
towels, exposing the body as little as possible, and,
if she is to return to bed, put on a fresh night
gown, and wrapper and slippers. Next place the
lower sheet, the draw sheet, and one pillow on the
bed as quickly as possible, help the patient into
bed, keeping her well covered with a blanket, and
finish making the bed. If she seems chilly, give a
hot water bag and hot drink and leave the blanket
next her in place. After the patient has been
made comfortable, clean the tub and put the bath
room in order.</p>

<p>Even patients supposedly able to take tub
baths without assistance should not lock the bath
room door nor be left alone a long time.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bed Bath.</h4><p>&mdash;Practice is essential in order to give
a bed bath skillfully. The aim is to make the
patient thoroughly clean and thoroughly dry,
without chilling, fatiguing, or exposing her,
without making the bed damp, and without unnecessary<!-- Page 157 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
haste or delay. One method of giving
a bed bath follows, but any method that accomplishes
these aims is likely to be satisfactory.</p></div>

<p>First see that the room is about 70¬∞ F. and likely
to remain so, and exclude draughts. Collect
everything to be used, including a blanket to cover
the patient, an old blanket or large bath towel to
protect the bed, at least two other towels, one a
bath towel and the other a face towel, two wash
cloths, soap, nail brush, powder, alcohol, comb and
brush, nail file, scissors, etc.; fresh bed and personal
linen; a large basin containing water at 105¬∞,
a jug of hotter water, and a slop jar. Remove the
upper bed clothes except one blanket, which
should cover the patient constantly during the
bath, and spread them where they will air; remove
all the pillows but one, and place the bath blanket
under the patient as the under sheet is placed in
bed making. If a bath blanket is not used, keep
the bath towel under the part that is being bathed
by moving the towel from place to place.</p>

<p>Next remove the night gown in the following
way: Let the patient lie on her back, with her
knees flexed; draw the gown up as far as possible,
then raise or get her to raise her hips so that the
gown may be drawn up above the waist. Next
raise her head and shoulders with one arm and
draw the night gown up to the neck with the<!-- Page 158 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
other; remove one sleeve, draw the gown over the
head and then off the other arm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.&mdash;Washing a Patient Without Exposure.</span> (<cite>Sanders
"Modern Methods in Nursing."</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>The patient is now ready for the bath. Wet the
wash cloth thoroughly, but hold it gathered in the
hand so that it will not drip. Wash the face,
neck, and ears first, dry them thoroughly, and
next, using the second wash cloth, wash the arms
and hands, chest and abdomen, giving particular
attention to the armpits and navel. Raise the<!-- Page 159 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
blanket slightly with one hand to keep it from
becoming damp, but expose the patient as little as
possible; the arms and legs need not remain
covered while being washed. Dry each part
thoroughly before washing the next. Next turn
the patient on her side and wash the back, the
buttocks, and upper part of the thighs; give special
attention to the fold between the buttocks.
Then turn the patient on her back, and wash the
thighs, legs, and feet. If it is important to move
the patient as little as possible, leave the back
until last so that the under sheet may be changed
without turning her again. Cut the toe nails if
necessary before washing, and clean them carefully
afterward. Unless there is a reason to the
contrary, wash the hands and the feet in the basin,
first protecting the bed with a towel, newspaper, or
clean wrapping paper. Be sure to clean well
between the toes, and to dry the feet thoroughly;
they may need some friction. Throughout the
bath empty and refill the basin as necessary.</p>

<p>Wash the genital region last. Let the patient
lie upon her back with knees flexed and separated,
or upon one side with the knees flexed and one
slightly raised. Patients who are able may take
this part of the bath themselves with whatever
assistance may be necessary. The attendant,
however, must either do it herself or make sure<!-- Page 160 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that the patient does it thoroughly. To neglect a
helpless patient is always unkind, and no less unkind
when the motive is a mistaken sense of
modesty. If discharge from the genitals is present
use absorbent cotton, or clean, soft old cloth
to wash the parts, and burn it afterward. It is
sometimes desirable to place the patient on a bedpan
and rinse the parts by a gentle stream of
warm water poured from a jug. After the attendant
has completed this part of the bath she
should wash her own hands thoroughly.</p>

<p>After the bath rub the patient with alcohol. If
a complete alcohol rub is impossible, at least rub
the points where pressure comes, especially the
back. After the rub apply a little toilet powder
if the patient desires it. When the toilet is complete
remove the bath blanket, remake the bed and
put the room in order.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of the Mouth and Teeth.</h4><p>&mdash;In sickness the
mouth and teeth require more than ordinary
attention; indeed, the condition of a patient's
mouth is a fair index to the quality of the care she
is receiving. If the patient can brush her own
teeth she should do so in the morning, at night,
and after meals. At those times the attendant,
without waiting to be asked, should bring her a
towel, tooth-brush, cup of tepid water, tooth paste
or powder, and a small basin or dish to receive the<!-- Page 161 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
used water. The process is generally more
thorough when the patient does it herself, and
even a patient unable to sit up can brush her
teeth successfully if the nurse holds the powder<!-- Page 162 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and cup of water, and provides a basin shallow
enough for the patient to use by turning her head
to one side.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img class="photo" src="images/fig17.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.&mdash;The Nurse Assisting the Patient in Brushing the Teeth.</span>
(<cite>From "Elementary Nursing Procedures," California State Board of Health.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>The attendant must cleanse the mouth of a
patient who is unable to do it herself. If this
cleansing is neglected, a dark tenacious substance
collects upon the teeth and gums, composed chiefly
of food particles, bacteria, mouth secretions, and
worn out cells of the mucous membrane. Once
formed it is difficult to remove, hence the mouths
of all patients and especially those who have fever,
must receive proper care from the very beginning
of illness. Cotton swabs are convenient for
cleansing the mouth; they are made by winding
a small piece of absorbent cotton upon a match or
wooden tooth-pick.</p>

<p>To cleanse the mouth of a helpless patient, take
to the bedside the mouth wash prescribed by the
doctor, a towel to protect the bedclothes, several
swabs, and a receptacle for used swabs; the latter
should be a strong paper bag or several thicknesses
of newspaper. Clean the tongue, gums, teeth,
and spaces between the teeth gently but thoroughly,
using especial care if the gums are tender.
Dip only clean swabs in the solution, discard
each one after using it once, and burn it afterward.
Let the patient rinse her mouth after
cleansing it if she is strong enough. If the mouth<!-- Page 163 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is very dry, encourage her to drink more water.
Notify the doctor if the gums and tongue crack
or bleed since he may wish to order a special
mouth wash. Cold cream or boracic ointment
may be used if the lips are dry and cracked.</p>

<p>False teeth should be thoroughly brushed and
cleansed, and kept in cold water if taken out during
the night.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of the Hair.</h4><p>&mdash;Long hair, if neglected,
becomes tangled and matted in a surprisingly
short time. Unless the patient is actually in a
dying condition she is not too sick to have it
properly attended to at least once a day. Before
combing the hair protect the pillow with a towel;
then part the hair in the middle from the forehead
to the nape of the neck, and draw it to either side.
Begin to comb at the ends, holding the strand of
hair firmly in one hand placed between the head
and the comb; in this way tangles can be removed
without hurting. After combing and brushing
the hair, braid it in two braids, beginning near the
ears; draw it as tightly or loosely near the head as
the patient prefers, but remember that tight
braids mean fewer tangles. If the hair is heavy
or badly tangled the patient may be too much
fatigued to have it all combed at one time; in this
case braid the part that has been finished and
complete the work later.</p></div>

<p><!-- Page 164 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To Wash the Hair of a Bed Patient.</h4><p>&mdash;The hair
of a patient can be successfully washed in bed if
sufficient care is taken not to chill or tire the
patient, or to wet the bed. The following articles
are needed: one small jug of strong soap suds made
by dissolving a pure soap in hot water, one large
jug of hot water at about 112¬∞ F., one jug of
cold water, a slop jar or foot tub, one long rubber
sheet or piece of enamel cloth, and several towels
including at least one bath towel. Let the
patient lie as near the edge of the bed as possible.
Roll one small towel lengthwise, place it below the
hair at the back of the neck, bring it up above the
ears to the forehead and pin tightly, in order to
catch water that might wet the face and neck.
Next make a kind of trough of the large rubber by
rolling its long edges inward for a few inches.
Place this across the bed under the patient's head
so that her neck rests on the lower roll. Raise
by means of pillows the end of the rubber trough
that lies toward the middle of the bed, in order to
prevent water from running into the bed or collecting
under the patient's head. Let the other end
of the rubber extend over the edge of the bed
down into the slop jar or foot tub, which may be
placed on a chair or stool. Then wash the hair
and scalp with the soap solution, and rinse them
thoroughly with water from the large jug. Squeeze<!-- Page 165 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as much water as possible from the hair, remove
the rubber and substitute a heavy bath towel, and
rub and fan the hair until dry. A shampoo in bed
is tiring. Do not attempt it unless the patient is
strong enough to stand not only the shampoo
itself, but also a complete change of bed clothing,
which will almost certainly be necessary if the
attendant has been careless or clumsy in the
slightest degree.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Hot foot baths</h4>&nbsp;<p>properly speaking are medical
treatment, but they are taken by many persons
to relieve colds, headache, or insomnia. Let
the patient sit, well wrapped, with her feet in
water at about 105¬∞, and then increase the
temperature gradually by adding hotter water.
Take care to add hot water slowly and not to
pour it directly upon the patient's feet or ankles;
otherwise she may be scalded. Mustard may
be added to the bath water in the proportion of
one tablespoonful of mustard to each gallon of
water. If mustard is to be used make it into a
smooth paste with cold water, thin the paste
with warm water, and when thin enough to pour
easily add it to the bath water and stir well.
The bath may continue for 10 to 20 minutes, and
the feet should be dried afterward without
friction. The patient should go to bed at once;
she should not wander about, clearing away her<!-- Page 166 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
foot bath, doing forgotten things, getting herself
chilled, and losing all the good effects.</p></div>

<p>A foot bath may be given easily to a patient
in bed. Bring to the bedside a blanket, a towel,
the tub filled with water, and something with
which to protect the bed; this may be a rubber
sheet, bath towel, old blanket folded, or several
thick clean newspapers. Loosen the upper covers
at the foot of the bed, fold them back above the
patient's knees, and cover her legs and feet with
the extra blanket making it overlap the bed
clothing so that it will not slip. Flex the patient's
knees, put the bed protector under her feet,
place the tub on the side of the bed, raise the legs
and feet with one hand and arm, and slide the
tub into place with the other, raising the elbow
in such a way that it keeps the blanket out of
the water. Lower the feet slowly into the water,
fold the towel, and place it over the edge of the
tub in order to protect the patient's knees from
the cold rim; then tuck the blanket closely about
the tub and legs and proceed as before. After
the bath use the towel, unless it is wet, to receive
the feet when they are withdrawn from the tub.
Remove the tub, dry the feet thoroughly, cover
them warmly, and remake the bed.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Cool Sponge Bath.</h4><p>&mdash;For feverish patients
doctors often order cool sponge baths. In order<!-- Page 167 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to give a cool sponge bath, first protect the bed
thoroughly, but leave the patient uncovered
except for a towel laid over the hips. Use cool
water, or cool water and alcohol, and have the
wash cloth as wet as it can be without dripping.
Bathe the body without friction, using long,
light strokes, and leave each part wet until the
bath has been completed. Do not use soap.
Sponge in this way the arms, legs, chest, and
back, but not the abdomen, for ten to twenty
minutes, giving special attention to the neck
and inner side of the arms and legs, because in
those places large blood vessels lie nearer the surface
of the body. After finishing the bath dry the
body by patting it gently with towels.</p></div>

<p>Take the patient's pulse occasionally during the
bath, and stop the bath at once if the patient's
pulse grows weaker, if she shivers violently,
or if her face, fingers, or toes turn a bluish color.
Babies react rapidly to cool sponging; for a baby
use tepid water, sponge for five minutes only,
and watch the child closely during the bath.</p>

<br />
APPLIANCES AND METHODS FOR THE
SICK-ROOM</h2>

<p>Patients who are confined to bed even for a few
days often suffer acutely from muscular tension,
from pressure, and from fatigue due to lack of
exercise. Indeed, many a sick person is surprised
to find that the bed which had seemed so infinitely
desirable can change into a place of torment after
a few short days of illness. "Bed-weariness" is
hard to bear in any case of illness, but it is doubly
hard for persons who are really helpless.</p>

<p>Unless the patient is an experienced sufferer he
often has no idea what should be done to make him
comfortable; while an equally inexperienced helper,
though full of good will, is often discouraged to
find that the arrangement she had thought perfect
soon fails to satisfy her restless patient. But if
she is willing to devote thought and ingenuity to
removing small annoyances, she can do many
things to alleviate his misery.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bed sores</h4><p>, or pressure sores, are caused by continued
pressure upon the skin. The weight of the<!-- Page 170 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
body, or of a part of the body, if it comes for a
long time upon one place finally interferes with
the circulation in the tissues on which the part
rests, and consequently interferes with the nutrition
of the affected part. Any tissue to which the
blood is not bringing all its necessary food supply
tends to lose its tone, to become weak, and if the
condition persists, to break down altogether.</p></div>

<p>The direct cause of bed sores then is pressure,
and pressure is aggravated by moisture, wrinkles
in the bed clothes, crumbs or other hard particles,
lack of cleanliness, friction of any kind, or by rough,
careless handling. Bed sores occur most often
over bony prominences, such as the end of the
spine, elbows, heels, shoulders, hips, ankles, and
knees, but they may form anywhere, even on the
ears or back of the head. They are more likely to
appear on thin, aged, or depleted patients. These
painful and serious sores can be prevented almost
always by faithful care. When they occur, they
result in the great majority of cases purely from
negligence, and a person who knows the danger
and yet through carelessness allows one to develop
upon a patient may justly feel herself disgraced.</p>

<p>Prevention of bed sores depends upon keeping
the skin dry and clean and upon relieving pressure
by special devices and by turning the patient
frequently. The parts where pressure comes<!-- Page 171 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
should be washed at least twice daily with warm
water and soap, rubbed frequently with alcohol to
improve the circulation and to keep up the tone of
the skin, and powdered with a little good toilet
powder. Much powder is likely to do harm by
collecting in hard, irritating particles. The bed
should be kept constantly dry and smooth, and
free from crumbs, lumps, wrinkles, or other inequalities.
Prolonged pressure should be relieved
by turning the patient often,&mdash;once every waking
hour is not too often if the body is emaciated,&mdash;and
by pillows, pads, and rings.</p>

<p>Small pillows or thick pads of cotton should be
placed under the patient's back and shoulders,
between the knees and ankles when he lies on his
side, and in other places where sores are likely to
develop. Rubber rings are useful, but few patients
like them for a long time. They should not be
inflated more than necessary to raise the affected
part from the bed; if much inflated, they are uncomfortable
and may do harm. The ring may be
covered with a muslin pillow case, or it may be
wound smoothly with long strips of bandage or old
muslin. Ordinary cotton batting wound with
strips of muslin may be made into rings and used
to remove pressure from heels, elbows, or other
parts. These cotton rings are less heating than
pads, and give better support.</p>

<p><!-- Page 172 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
The first sign of a bed sore is either redness of the
skin or a dark discoloration like a bruise. Every
point where a bed sore may form should be inspected
daily. If the slightest symptom of a sore
appears, the patient must not lie on the affected
part, and every effort should be made to keep the
skin from breaking; vigorous rubbing at this stage
is dangerous, and will by no means make up for
previous neglect. The condition should be reported
to the doctor at once. If in spite of all
efforts the skin does break, a peculiarly difficult
kind of open wound results which must be treated
and dressed according to the doctor's directions.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Devices to Give Support.</h4><p>&mdash;The variety and
number of pillows one patient can use is almost
unlimited. A weak patient when lying on his side
should have his back supported by a pillow. When
he lies on his back a pillow should be placed under
his knees to lessen muscular tension, and if he
may be raised in bed, several pillows are needed to
support him comfortably. A back rest is useful
for a patient who can sit up in bed. Satisfactory
back rests of several types can be purchased, or
one may be improvised from a straight chair
placed on the bed bottom side up, so that its legs
lie against the head of the bed and its back forms
an inclined plane. Back rest and chair alike
should be covered by several pillows to make them<!-- Page 173 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
comfortable, and other pillows should be used to
support the patient's arms.</p></div>

<p>A person who is sitting up in bed always tends
to slip down toward the foot. This tendency
may be corrected by using a foot rest, knee pad,
or pillow. A hard pillow may be placed in
the bed at the foot for the patient to brace his
feet against; or a short board, well padded, may
be arranged as follows for the feet to rest against:
Fasten ropes to the board, as the ropes of a swing
are fastened to the seat; set the padded board
on edge at a convenient point below the patient's
feet, and hold it in place by tying the ropes of
the "swing" to the head of the bed. A pillow
may be used in the same way, either at the feet
or under the knees, by folding it over a long strip
of muslin, the ends of which are then tied to the
sides of the bed, brought up to the head, and there
tied to prevent slipping. A cylindrical cushion
six or eight inches in diameter and as long as an
ordinary pillow, stuffed with firm material, may
also be used for this purpose. It should be
held in place by strips of strong muslin or ticking
sewed to the ends of the cushion and tied to
the head of the bed. The cushion should have
a washable cover.</p>

</div>

<p>Supports called <i>bed cradles</i> are used to keep the
weight of the bed covers from sensitive parts of<!-- Page 174 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the body, generally the feet or abdomen. They
are semi-circular pieces of wood or iron fastened
together so that they will stand up. A satisfactory
cradle may be improvised as follows:
Cut a barrel hoop in two, cross the halves at
right angles and tie them together firmly; place
the cradle over the affected part under the bed
clothes. A smaller cradle may be made by taking
sections that are less than half of the barrel
hoop. If used for one foot only, the cradle should<!-- Page 175 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
be small enough not to interfere with the motion
of the other foot; if used for both feet, it should
be large enough to allow some freedom of motion.
Since the cradle leaves an air space, the feet
should be wrapped in a piece of soft flannel.
A cradle used for the protection of the abdomen
should extend a little beyond the body on each
side.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 19.&mdash;Adjustable Bed Rest.</span>
</div>

<p>Adjustable tables are convenient for patients
who are able to sit up in bed. These tables are
supported on one side only so that they may extend
over the bed. Another kind of bedside
table has short legs and stands directly on the
bed. Such a table can easily be made at home
from a wide board with supports six or eight<!-- Page 176 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
inches high nailed to each end. A lap board supported
by heavy books may serve for temporary
use. Indeed, home-made substitutes are often as
good as expensive apparatus or even better. If
sick-room appliances must be bought, it is well to
remember that simple standard designs are best.
Complicated apparatus is soon out of order, and is
generally a trial both to the patient and to those
who must adjust it. Persons taking care of
chronic patients may often obtain valuable suggestions
in regard to appliances by consulting
a visiting nurse or the superintendent of the local
hospital.</p>

<h4>Bedpans</h4>&nbsp;<p>are utensils to receive bowel and bladder
discharges of patients lying in bed. Enamel<!-- Page 177 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bedpans are better than porcelain, although more
expensive. The shape known as the "Perfection"
is best for general use. A "slipper" bedpan,
although harder to clean and ordinarily
less comfortable, may be preferable if it is especially
difficult or undesirable to raise the patient.
The square or douche pan is preferred by some
people, and is especially useful when the quantity
of discharge is large, as after an injection.</p></div>

<p>When a patient asks for the bedpan it should
be brought if possible without a moment's delay,
not only because no other form of neglect makes
a patient realize her helplessness more acutely,
but also because the desire to use it often passes
quickly and delay may encourage the habit of
constipation. If the patient does not ask for
the bedpan, the attendant should offer it at
suitable times. Bedpans should be warmed
before use. An easy way to warm one is to let
hot water run over it; the outside should afterward
be dried.</p>

<p>To place the bedpan, first flex the patient's
knees and push the night gown up; place one hand
under the patient's hips, raise them slightly,
and with the other hand slip the pan into place.
If the patient is entirely helpless two persons
are needed to lift her. Place a pad or folded
cloth between the patient's back and the pan;<!-- Page 178 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
then lower the patient gently. Before removing
the pan, bring toilet paper, water and two pieces
of soft old muslin or gauze. A patient, if able,
prefers to use the toilet paper without assistance;
her hands should afterward be thoroughly washed.
If she is unable, the attendant must do everything
needed. After the patient has been cleaned
as thoroughly as possible with paper raise her
hips with one hand and then remove the pan;
it is important to raise her first because the skin
often adheres and may be injured if the pan is
suddenly pulled away; carelessness in managing
the bedpan has caused more than one bed sore.
Then remove the pan with one hand and cover
at once. Turn the patient, if helpless, on her side,
wash the parts with one piece of old muslin,
thoroughly dry them with the other, and either
burn or thoroughly wash both pieces afterward.</p>

<p>Empty the bedpan and clean it at once; ordinarily
one can clean it without wetting or soiling
the hands. Use cold water first, removing all
adhering solid particles with a tightly rolled
piece of toilet paper. Do not use a brush for
this purpose. After using cold water, rinse the
pan thoroughly in hot water, and at least once a
day wash it well in hot soapsuds. Directions for
disinfecting the pan will be given later, but remember
that a properly kept pan needs no deodorant<!-- Page 179 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
solution. Glass urinals should be provided for
men, and kept clean in the same way. Contents
of both bedpan and urinal should always be carefully
inspected; neither should be emptied in the
dark.</p>

<h3>DAILY ROUTINE IN THE SICK-ROOM</h3>

<p>Obviously the routine of a patient's day must
vary according to her condition, her preferences,
and the amount of time the attendant has to give
her. The temperature, pulse, and respiration
must be taken and all medicine, nourishment, and
treatment given at the exact times ordered, but
the attendant should learn whether or not the
doctor wishes her to wake the patient for food or
treatment. Good management in the sick-room
depends upon foresight and planning, and therefore
it is well to keep in mind the following
suggestions:</p>

<p>Vitality is lowest in the early morning, hence
baths and treatments, especially if they are fatiguing
or painful, should if possible be left until after
breakfast. Patients often wake early and wait,
weak and miserable, for the day to begin. A hot
drink at this time may give relief and enable the
patient to sleep again. Even though breakfast
time is near, nourishment should be given as soon
as the patient wakes. She may not admit that<!-- Page 180 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
she is hungry, but her nourishment should not be
delayed until the family breakfast is ready, or still
worse, finished.</p>

<p>Before breakfast the bedpan should be offered,
the patient's face and hands should be washed,
her teeth brushed, her hair tidied, the bed straightened,
and the room put in order. These services
should require a few minutes only. The room if
properly arranged at bed time needs only a little
attention now unless untidy work has gone on
during the night; disorder in a sick-room is as
unnecessary in the early morning as at any other
time.</p>

<p>After the patient has finished her breakfast she
may rest, or if allowed, read her mail or the newspaper
while the attendant prepares for her day's
work; about an hour after breakfast the patient
should be bathed, unless she prefers her bath in
the evening. After the bath some form of light
nourishment should be given, even to a patient
who has regular meals. If a patient is able to
sit up in a chair, the best time for her to do so is
generally just after the bath and toilet have been
completed; but if she feels tired she had better
wait until afternoon. The bed room can be
better aired and cleaned if it is possible to take her
into another room; and she herself generally
profits by a change of scene.</p>

<p><!-- Page 181 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
The doctor should definitely state when and for
how long a patient may sit up for the first time
after an illness, and an amateur who may be
ignorant of the dangers involved should not assume
the responsibility of deciding. When a
patient is to sit up for the first time, put on her
stockings, slippers, and wrapper before she leaves
the bed. Arrange an arm chair with pillows in
the seat and at the back, bring it close to the
bedside and cover it with a large blanket unfolded.
The chair may face either the head or the foot of
the bed. Help the patient to a sitting position on
the extreme edge of the bed, with her feet hanging
down. Next, standing in front of her and supporting
her well, let her slip down until she stands
upon her feet, then let her turn, and gently lower
her into the chair. See that the patient while
sitting up is warmly covered, and that her foot-stool,
pillows, etc., are adjusted comfortably.
Move her chair so that the outlook may be as
interesting as possible, and at least a little different
from the view from the bed. Most patients like
to look out of the window; children and old people
enjoy it particularly.</p>

<p>If the patient shows signs of fatigue, she should
go back to bed even before the appointed time.
To help her back to bed, reverse the process of
helping her out. A footstool may be needed<!-- Page 182 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
if the bed is high, or two people to lift her if she is
weak or heavy. When a patient is in bed no
one should ever sit on the bed, lean against it,
use it as a table for folding linen, making pads,
etc., take hold of the bed posts in passing, or
touch the bed unnecessarily in any way.</p>

<p>The best time for visitors is the last of the morning
or the early afternoon. A judicious visitor
may do an immense amount of good, especially
to a chronic patient; indeed, she may be the only
ray of light in a dark day. Subjects of conversation
should be pleasant, but not too stimulating
or exciting. The visitor should be prepared to
carry the burden of the conversation, to drop
topics skillfully that seem to involve fatigue or
excitement, and either to go or to stop talking if
the patient seems tired. Visitors should remember
to talk naturally and cheerfully on ordinary
topics, and to avoid excessive sympathy and
labored attempts to cheer the patient. They
should also remember that few patients bear well
even the mildest forms of teasing. The patient's
room is not the place to discuss personal or family
troubles; yet it is only too often chosen for such
purposes, probably because the complainer knows
that in it an audience is always to be found.</p>

<p>Visitors not belonging to the family should not
be present in the sick-room during treatment of<!-- Page 183 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
any kind, unless their help is required; neither,
as a rule, should they stay during the patient's
meals. A member of the family may stay with
advantage if the patient tires of eating alone, but
casual visitors almost invariably offend by undue
urging if the patient's appetite is poor, or by facetious
remarks if it is good.</p>

<p>Ordinarily only one visitor should be admitted
at a time, since a weak patient may be tired merely
by looking from one to another. If it is desirable
to limit the call, the attendant should tell the
visitor beforehand how long to stay, or arrange a
signal for the visit to end. To announce baldly
in the sick-room that the patient is tired and the
visitor must go, will only elicit aggrieved protests
from both. In illness lasting only a day or two
all visitors should be discouraged; during colds,
because they are communicable; during general
fatigue, headaches, digestive upsets, and painful
menstruation, because rest and quiet are highly
desirable. Visitors at such times too frequently
give injudicious sympathy, and may actually
delay the recovery of patients who enjoy playing
the r√¥le of interesting invalid.</p>

<p>The time when a trustworthy visitor is present
may be the best time for the attendant to rest.
The patient should be told when the attendant is
going, and approximately when she will return.<!-- Page 184 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
It is a mistake to slip away while the patient sleeps;
she seldom fails to wake before the time scheduled
and to resent the desertion. Surprises of any
kind, pleasant or unpleasant, are seldom good for
patients.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the afternoon the patient
is probably tired, especially if she has not slept
during the day. When fever is present her headache
and restlessness increase as the day goes on,
but it should be remembered that uncomfortable
beds and too heavy covers cause much of the
restlessness attributed to fever. Rubbing the
back and legs with alcohol, giving a tepid sponge
bath, remaking the bed or changing her position
may help to soothe her.</p>

<p>The evening should be kept free from excitement,
and every possible effort should be made
to encourage sleep. It is a mistake to think that
a better night results from keeping a sleepy
patient awake all the evening; sick people should
sleep when they can. Just before bedtime the
attendant should prepare her own cot, and then
make the following preparations for the patient
to sleep: wash the patient's face and hands or
give a sponge bath if it is desired, brush the hair,
change the night gown, brush crumbs from the
bed, tighten the sheets or remake the bed if necessary,
rub the back and other pressure points<!-- Page 185 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
with alcohol, shake the pillows, give liquid nourishment,
preferably hot, cleanse the mouth, and
give the bedpan. See that the patient's feet are
warm, the bed covers right, the room ventilated
properly and in good order, and the light extinguished
or arranged for the night. If the patient
is inclined to be wakeful a hot foot bath may
help her, or sponging the entire length of the spine
for fifteen minutes, using very hot water and long
downward quiet strokes. No conversation should
be encouraged during preparations for the night.
Patients in bed all day often lose the habit of
sleeping at the regular time, and lie awake far into
the night from a vague feeling that someone else
is coming or something further is to be done for
them. Consequently last of all ask the patient
if she wants anything more; if not, say good-night,
go out and stay out, at least until she has
had a chance to go to sleep. She is thus helped to
realize that nothing further is likely to happen,
and that it is time to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Toward morning the patient grows weaker.
More bed covers will probably be needed, and
they may often be added without waking her.
Night at the best is a dreary time for the sick.
Pain and weariness and discouragement are less
bearable in the darkness; nervous fears and morbid
fancies defy control. Never is kindness more<!-- Page 186 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
needed or more appreciated than it is by those who
lie awake and watch for the morning.</p>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
<br />
FEEDING THE SICK</h2>

<p>Substances used for food are generally grouped
into three classes, called the three nutrients. The
nutrients are: first, the proteids or nitrogenous
substances, which are found in meat, fish, eggs,
milk, cheese, peas, beans, etc.; second, the carbohydrates,
which include sugars and starch; and
third, the fats, which are found in butter, oil, the fat
of meat, etc. In addition to the nutrients, water
and certain mineral salts are essential to life,
while some indigestible material like the fibre of
vegetables is needed to give bulk and to stimulate
the action of the intestines.</p>

<p>The nutrients furnish the body with materials
for growth, and for repair of tissues worn out by
use; they also furnish fuel substances from which
the body obtains its heat and its energy. All
three nutrients can serve as fuel, but the proteids
alone can furnish materials for growth and repair
of tissues. In order to be used by the body for
any purpose, nutrients must first go through a
series of complicated changes known as digestion,<!-- Page 188 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which renders them soluble so that they can soak
through the walls of the intestine.</p>

<h3>THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS</h3>

<p>Digestion begins in the mouth. There the
food is crushed and its fibres separated by the
teeth, it is moistened by the saliva, and substances
in the saliva begin a chemical action upon the
starch. Chewing should be sufficient to reduce
the food to a soft mass well moistened with saliva.
Slow eating is desirable, but the emphasis should
be placed on thorough chewing. For instance,
long intervals between bites are of no special benefit
if mouthfuls of food are washed down by swallows
of water.</p>

<p>After it has been swallowed, the food passes into
the stomach and remains there for a variable
length of time, while it undergoes further preparation
for absorption. It is moved about by the
contraction of the muscular walls of the stomach,
so that it becomes mixed with the stomach juices
and more thoroughly softened. Some digestion
of proteids goes on in the stomach, and a little
absorption through the walls.</p>

<p>Little by little the food is discharged from the
stomach into the small intestine, and the most
important part of digestion then begins. It is
acted upon chemically by a fluid flowing into the<!-- Page 189 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
intestine from an organ called the pancreas; this
pancreatic juice acts upon all three nutrients and is
of great importance in the digestive process. The
bile and other juices that flow into the intestine
perform important functions also.</p>

<p>The food masses are moved along by rhythmic
contractions of the intestine, and absorption goes
on when the food has been so changed that it can
soak through the intestinal walls into the blood
and lymph vessels. The small intestine is about
20 feet long, and consequently affords a large
surface for absorption, as does also the large intestine,
into which the small intestine opens. The
blood and lymph carry the digested food substances
to all parts of the body, and thus the different
tissues are provided with the materials they
need for growth, repair, and energy. Excess of
food substances may be stored as fat or expelled
from the body.</p>

<p>As the blood and lymph go through the tissues
they take from the tissues the refuse, or the part
that remains after the fuel substances have been
consumed. This refuse from the tissues may be
likened to the ashes from a furnace; it is finally
eliminated from the body through the kidneys and
lungs, and to some extent through the skin and
bowels. The part of the food that is not digested
of course never soaks through the intestinal walls;<!-- Page 190 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
it merely passes through the small and large intestines
and is finally expelled as feces or bowel
movements. The characteristic odor of fecal
matter results from the action of bacteria upon it
while in the large intestine.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the body is not
nourished merely by swallowing food: in order to
nourish the body food must also be digested, absorbed,
and made use of by the tissues. Many
factors may operate both in health and in sickness
to render food indigestible. It may be originally
unsuited to the human digestive apparatus, or
spoiled, or poor in quality, or badly cooked. But
even when wholesome in itself it may be ill-adapted
to a particular person at a particular time;
thus it may be too great in amount, or eaten at
improper hours. Moreover a person's own idiosyncrasy
or manner of living or fatigue or illness
may render it especially indigestible for him.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that pain, fear, worry,
and other unpleasant emotions actually stop the
action of the digestive juices and check muscular
contractions of the small intestine. Furthermore,
even the absence of pleasant anticipation of food
has been shown to delay digestion for hours.
Thus scientific knowledge confirms our common
experience that such mental states seriously
interfere with digestion. The converse is also<!-- Page 191 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
true. Agreeable taste and odor of food, or even
pleasurable thought of it, start the secretion of
digestive fluids. It is a common saying that the
mouth waters at the prospect of inviting food, but
it is less well known that appetizing food does
actually start the stomach juices also. A person
who understands the physiological effect that the
emotions have upon digestion is in a far better
frame of mind to cope successfully with the difficulties
of feeding the sick than one who considers
sick persons' likes and dislikes entirely irrational.</p>

<h3>FEEDING THE SICK</h3>

<p>Nourishing the sick is not always an easy problem,
but its importance can hardly be overestimated.
Indeed, proper feeding in many illnesses
makes the difference between life and death. The
actual amount of nourishment needed in sickness
is often less than in health, but it may be just as
great, or even greater if the illness causes increased
tissue waste. Yet the digestive process of a sick
person must be rendered as little laborious as
possible, all foods ordinarily difficult to digest must
be eliminated, certain others must be withheld or
restricted according to the nature of the sickness,
and in addition one may have to deal with an
appetite that is capricious, diminished, or totally
absent.</p>

<p><!-- Page 192 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Diet for the sick is often a part of medical
treatment; in such cases the doctor will prescribe
special diets and his orders must be carefully
carried out. Except for special diets, food for the
sick is generally divided into four classes: first,
liquid or fluid diet; second, semi-solid diet; third,
light or convalescent diet; and lastly, full diet.
These diets are not very sharply distinguished.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Liquid diet</h4>&nbsp;<p>generally includes milk, eggnog,
albumen water, broths, soup, beef juice, thin
gruel, and beverages. Liquid diet makes least
demand upon the digestive powers, because it consists
of food already dissolved and therefore nearer
the condition in which it can be absorbed. Moreover,
it is less likely than other foods to contain
excess of fat, improperly cooked starches, and other
indigestible material. Liquids must be given at
regular intervals and at shorter intervals than
solid foods; 6 to 8 ounces every two or three hours
is not too much if the patient can take it. The doctor
usually specifies the amount and the interval.
Some patients will take more nourishment at one
time if the interval is slightly increased.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Semi-solid diet</h4>&nbsp;<p>includes all fluids and in addition
soft milk toast, soft cooked eggs, well cooked
cereal, custards, ice cream and ices, junket, and
gelatine jellies. Liquid or semi-solid diet is commonly
given in acute fevers because digestive<!-- Page 193 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
juices and other fluids of the body are then diminished,
and also because their digestion places a
minimum of work upon a system already burdened
with bacterial poisons.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Light or convalescent diet</h4>&nbsp;<p>generally means a
simple mixed diet. In addition to the articles in
the two preceding diets it includes oysters, chicken,
baked potatoes, most fruits except bananas, simple
desserts, white fish, and other meats and vegetables
added judiciously until full diet is reached. Fried
foods should not be included.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Full diet</h4>&nbsp;<p>means an unrestricted menu, but even
from full diets especially indigestible foods should
be excluded. The principles of feeding sedentary
persons as described in manuals of dietetics apply
to patients who are obliged to be inactive although
not really ill, as for example, a patient suffering
from a broken leg. Ordinarily in such cases, as in
other kinds of illness, the appetite is greatly
diminished, but a word of warning should be given
against overfeeding patients whose meals are their
chief interest. Such patients are only too likely
to interpret full diet as anything they desire in any
quantity at any time of day or night, and then to
attribute their discomfort and irritability to their
illness rather than to overeating.</p></div>

<p>Constipation is especially stubborn in sickness,
since the patient is deprived of his usual exercise<!-- Page 194 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and variety of food. So far as possible the bowels
should be regulated by diet. Laxative foods
include most vegetables with a large amount of
fibre, coarse cereals and flour, oils and fats, and
most fruits and fruit juices. Unfortunately many
laxative foods are difficult for sick persons to digest
and must therefore be used with caution. A glass
of hot or cold water or orange juice an hour before
breakfast may be helpful, and at bed time hot
lemonade, oranges, prunes, figs, or other fruit if
allowed.</p>

<p>It is essential for patients to drink water freely,
and it should be given between meals and also
between liquid nourishments. Persons inexperienced
in the care of the sick frequently make the
mistake of bringing water only when a patient
asks for it.</p>

<p>Many acute illnesses begin with fever, headache,
sore throat, and especially among children with
vomiting, diarrh≈ìa, and other digestive disturbances.
In such cases all food should be withheld
until the doctor comes, but boiled water, hot or
cold, should be given freely. Efforts to tempt the
appetite are then mistaken; few people are injured
and many are benefited by omitting food even for
24 hours at the beginning of an acute illness, and
with few exceptions a doctor can be found in a
shorter time.</p>

<p><!-- Page 195 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Serving Food for the Sick.</h4><p>&mdash;Food for the sick
should always be most carefully prepared and of
the best quality, and in addition it should be
as inviting, as varied, and as well served as possible.
Neglect in these respects is inexcusable.
Even slight carelessness in preparing or serving
food may arouse disgust and thus banish permanently
some valuable article from the dietary.</p></div>

<p>Trays, dishes, tray cloths, and napkins for the
patient must be absolutely clean and as attractive
as possible. Cracked or chipped dishes should
not be used. Individual sets of dishes for the
sick may be purchased, and their convenience
makes them well worth their price. Paper napkins
may be used in many cases to save laundry
work; clean white paper is always superior to
soiled linen.</p>

<p>Before the tray is brought to the bedside,
everything should be arranged so that the patient
can eat in comfort. It is bad management to
let the soup cool while the patient's pillows
and table are being adjusted. In setting the
tray great care should be devoted to placing the
articles conveniently, and to the appearance
and garnishing of the food. Careful serving
requires more thought, but little if any more actual
time than slovenly serving. Dishes should not
be so full that food is spilled in transit; hot dishes<!-- Page 196 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
should be covered; hot dishes should reach the
patient hot, and cold dishes cold. Liquid nourishment
in a glass or cup should be served on a
small tray or plate covered with a doily. Neither
glass nor cup should be held by the rim.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to overload trays and to
serve everything at once in order to save steps,
but a patient is ordinarily more interested in
a meal that is served in courses unless very
long intervals elapse between. Moreover, if the
meal is served in courses he is not tempted to
eat dessert first and then to refuse the rest of the
meal. If food is given sufficiently often it is
safer to err on the side of serving too little at a
time rather than too much, since the sight of
large amounts of food is often disgusting.</p>

<p>The patient's likes and dislikes should be considered
as far as possible, but most patients
should not be consulted about their menus
beforehand. Great variety in one meal is not
necessary; it should be introduced by varying
successive meals. An article that has been
especially disliked should not be served a second
time, unless it can be disguised beyond a possibility
of detection. An article of food to which a
patient objects should be removed at once; one
may appear disappointed if it seems wise, but
should never argue. When patients persistently<!-- Page 197 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
refuse necessary nourishment a difficult situation is
presented; persuasion and every form of ingenuity
must be used, and the doctor's co√∂peration enlisted.
When, for example, a strict milk diet
is ordered for a patient who announces that he
never takes milk in any circumstances the situation
may seem hopeless but it is not necessarily so.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>To Feed a Helpless Patient.</h4><p>&mdash;Helpless and
weak patients must be assisted to eat or drink.
A napkin should first be placed under the patient's
chin. The attendant should place her hand
under the pillow, raise the head slightly, and
hold the glass to his lips with her other hand.
An ordinary tumbler can be used by a patient
lying down if it is not more than a quarter full,
or a special feeding cup may be purchased. Bent
glass tubes may be used for cool liquids; they
should be washed immediately after use. A
child who can sit up sometimes takes more nourishment
if it is given through a soda water straw.</p></div>

<p>If the patient must be fed with a spoon care
should be taken that the liquid is not too hot,
but the attendant should not blow upon it to
cool it. It should be given from the point of a
spoon placed at right angles to the lips, and plenty
of time between mouthfuls should be allowed.
A swallow should not be given at the moment
when the patient is drawing the breath in. Great<!-- Page 198 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
patience is required if a helpless person is to be
fed acceptably. The attendant should sit by
the bedside rather than stand, should present
at least the appearance of having unlimited time,
and should endeavor not to deprive the patient
in any way of the satisfaction he may derive
from his nourishment.</p>

<br />
MEDICINES AND OTHER REMEDIES</h2>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Action of Drugs.</h4><p>&mdash;Modern medical practice increasingly
emphasizes diet, baths, exercises, and
other hygienic measures in the treatment of
sickness. Drugs are given far less than they were
a generation ago; yet medicines are still the most
familiar of all remedies, and the most abused by
those who persist in treating themselves. Misuse
of medicine even by intelligent people is astonishingly
common.</p></div>

<p>Problems of sickness and health would be
enormously clarified if the uses and limitations of
drugs were more generally understood. Many
people still believe that every disease can be cured
by a drug if only the doctor is clever or lucky
enough to think of the right one to give. Such
beliefs result naturally enough from centuries of
faith in charms and magic, and occasionally
are confirmed by remarkable cures apparently
brought about by drugs, but really pure coincidence
or the result of suggestion.</p>

<p>It is a fact that a few medicines are known<!-- Page 201 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
which if rightly used actually do cure certain
diseases. An example of their action is the curative
effect of quinine in malaria. Such medicines,
unfortunately, are few. In the great majority of
cases medicines do not cure disease; their beneficial
action is ordinarily indirect and is due to their
power either to increase or to check certain processes
within the body.</p>

<p>It is here that the abuse of drugs comes in.
Disordered bodily processes give rise to symptoms
of disease; and it is the symptoms of disease, not
the disease itself, that trouble the patient. A
patient with typhoid, for example, is not conscious
of the toxins in his blood, but of headache,
weakness, and fever; the man with eyestrain is
not aware of an imperfectly shaped lens, but of
headache and indigestion. What the patient
wants is to have his symptoms relieved; in some
cases they can be controlled by drugs, and the
sufferer then considers himself cured. But the
original condition persists: it may in the meantime
be improving, but it may on the other hand be
growing worse.</p>

<p>Not infrequently it is best to check symptoms,
and to check them by means of drugs. When they
should be checked, only a thoroughly trained
physician is qualified to decide. The question
is not one for amateurs, since the whole practice<!-- Page 202 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of medicine, including the prescription of drugs,
constantly becomes more nearly an exact science.
People should obtain and follow expert advice in
regard to health as they would in regard to other
affairs of life. The constant self-dosing practised
by thousands of people is harmful and unintelligent;
it is, however, no less irrational to go to the
other extreme and refuse to take medicine prescribed
by a competent doctor.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Amateur Dosing.</h4><p>&mdash;Amateur dosing either of
oneself or of others is dangerous in more ways
than one. In the first place, time is lost. Moreover,
symptoms are characteristic; checking or
altering them increases the difficulty of finding the
real trouble. The man with eyestrain who takes
one drug to stop his headache and another to
"cure" his stomach, is simply delaying the time
when properly adjusted glasses will relieve both.
In this case the result may not be serious; but such
a loss of time in finding the trouble and beginning
proper treatment might prove fatal in the case
of tuberculosis.</p></div>

<p>Another objection to amateur prescription of
medicine is the fact that most drugs have more
than one effect. In addition to their main action
they have others, subordinate or ordinarily less
marked. These minor effects may be serious in
some cases. Many headache remedies, for example,<!-- Page 203 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
affect the heart; a dose that is harmless for
a normal person may be strong enough to injure
seriously a person with a weak heart. A doctor,
and a doctor only, is competent to decide when
and in what quantity medicines will be beneficial,
because he alone understands both the condition
of the patient and all the possible effects of the
drug.</p>

<p>In no circumstances should medicine prescribed
for one person be taken by another. This rule
seems obvious enough; yet every day people pass
on their pet remedies to friends. Some medicines
deteriorate after standing, and others grow
stronger; nevertheless, medicine supposed to have
cured a cough or a tonic supposed to have strengthened
some member of the family after an attack
of grippe is cheerfully administered months later
to another member of the family, who, to make
matters worse, may differ in age, strength, and
probably in the nature of his sickness. Drugs are
expensive, and it is considered economical to use
them up; measured by lost time and impaired
health such practices may be anything but thrifty.</p>

<p>Cathartics, tonics, and various drugs to relieve
pain and sleeplessness are among the remedies
most commonly taken without medical advice.
Enough has already been said about constipation
to indicate proper hygienic treatment, but another<!-- Page 204 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
warning should be given against habitual use of
cathartics. Many of these drugs are irritating;
even when not irritating, they are harmful, since
the body depends more and more upon the drug
to do for it what it should be enabled to do for
itself, by remedying the original cause of the
trouble. Licorice powder, cascara, saline cathartics
such as Seidlitz powders and Rochelle
Salts and some others are harmless for occasional
use, if occasional is not too liberally interpreted.</p>

<p>Tonics are poor substitutes for proper diet,
rest, and fresh air. Using them may be likened
to beating a tired horse; the horse goes faster,
but he is not really stronger. In some emergencies
the horse must go faster and there is nothing to do
but beat him, and in some cases the tonic should
be given; these, however, are cases for a doctor
to decide. People persist in taking tonics because
they are unwilling or unable to rest, or otherwise
to change their ways of living.</p>

<p>Medicines to stop pain or to induce sleep are
probably the most pernicious of all self-prescribed
remedies, for they add to other dangers the possibility
of forming drug habits. These habits
are so insidious and so powerful that it is not safe
to take habit-forming drugs even once except by
a doctor's direction. In short periods of time
strong people, apparently firm in will and character,<!-- Page 205 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have acquired habits from supposedly moderate
use of drugs like morphine, cocaine, and
alcohol. No one, no matter how sure of his own
self-control, can afford to run so grave a risk.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Patent Remedies.</h4><p>&mdash;Objections to self dosing in
general apply even more strongly to using patent
medicines. The ingredients of patent medicines
are ordinarily unknown, so that using them is
unintelligent at best. Sometimes they contain
habit-forming or other harmful drugs. In other
cases the ingredients are innocent enough, but
totally unable to bring about the results claimed
for them. The old story about a powerful
remedy discovered by accident and thus unknown
to the medical profession deceives only the ignorant
or credulous; with our present knowledge of
chemistry and physiology powerful remedies are
not discovered in that way.</p></div>

<p>Even to these comparatively harmless patent
preparations there are two serious objections.
One is the loss of time, during which the patient
may grow worse. The other is that money is
obtained under false pretenses; fraud is a common
element in the success of patent remedies. One
of the least harmful, a substance called "Murine"
may be taken as an example<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. This substance was
widely advertised at one time as a "positive cure
for sore eyes." Analysis showed it to be a solution
<!-- Page 206 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>of borax, which cost about five cents a gallon to
prepare. It sold for one dollar an ounce, or at
the rate of $128.00 a gallon. Although it could
not bring about the wonderful cures advertised,
it was practically harmless, and buyers of "Murine"
must have been injured chiefly in pocket.
But with "cancer cures" and "consumption cures"
it is a different story. Early treatment of these
diseases is essential to recovery; delay in many
cases means robbing the sufferer of his only chance
of life. No drugs are now known that will cure
these diseases, and it seems incredible that anyone
should be willing to practise such cruel deception
upon ignorant people merely for the sake of making
money.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Administration of Medicine.</h4><p>&mdash;Medicines may
be introduced into the body in a number of ways.
In the majority of cases they are swallowed and
finally carried to the tissues by the blood just
as digested food is carried.</p></div>

<p>Except in rare emergencies no medicine should
be given to a sick person without the doctor's
order. The prescribed dose should be accurately
measured in a medicine glass having a scale to
show the number of teaspoonfuls. When measuring
medicine, think only of what you are doing;
neither talk nor listen to conversation. First
read the label on the bottle. Next, shake the<!-- Page 207 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
bottle, if the medicine is liquid, in order to mix
the contents thoroughly. Then remove the cork
with the second and third fingers, and hold it
between them while pouring, thus keeping the
cork clean and protecting the contents of the bottle.
Hold the medicine glass on a level with the eyes,
and in the other hand hold the bottle, with the
side bearing the label uppermost to avoid soiling
it; pour out the dose, measuring exactly, wipe
the bottle, replace the cork, and again read the
label on the bottle.</p>

<p>Most medicines should be diluted with a little
water. Pills and capsules should not be presented
to patients in the attendant's fingers, but on a
saucer or teaspoon. Acids and medicines containing
iron should be taken through a glass tube kept
for medicine exclusively. Tubes and glasses
should be washed at once after use, and neither
they nor the bottles should stay in the patient's
room. If a dose is omitted for any reason, do
not increase the next dose; give the regular dose
at the next regular time.</p>

<p>Serious mistakes in giving or taking drugs are
far too common, and no precautions are too great
to guard against them. Never use medicine from
a box or bottle that has no label. Never take or
give another person a medicine selected in the
dark, even though you have positive knowledge<!-- Page 208 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that there is no other bottle or box of medicine
in the whole house; in just such circumstances the
fatal mistakes occur.</p>

<p>A few things can be done to make medicines
more palatable. The water used to dilute the dose
and to be taken after it should be very cold.
Holding the nose is helpful. A piece of cracker,
a peppermint, or a slice of lemon or orange, if
allowed, may be taken afterward. Giving disagreeable
medicine in ordinary food, as lemon
juice, orange juice, or milk, and giving bitter
powders in jam or jelly, is unwise because it
sometimes results in life long dislike for a useful
article of diet. Where food is given directly after
the dose to take away its taste, the association of
dislike seems to be formed less frequently.</p>

<p>The taste of castor oil is so disgusting that it
often causes vomiting, but if skillfully given the oil
need not be tasted by a patient who is willing to
co√∂perate. Its way of sticking to the tongue and
teeth constitutes the chief difficulty; the object
therefore is to prevent it from sticking by swallowing
the dose all at once. To administer the oil,
wet the inside of a medicine glass or large spoon
with very cold water, and leave a little water in the
bottom. Pour the required dose in slowly and
cover it with more cold water. Let the patient
hold in his hand something to take away the<!-- Page 209 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
taste,&mdash;cracker, bread, peppermint, or whatever is
allowed; for castor oil water is not very effectual.
Then direct him to hold his nose, open his mouth,
and hold his breath; caution him to let the oil run
down without swallowing until all has been taken,
and afterward to chew the cracker, continuing to
hold his nose until he has swallowed the cracker.
When the patient understands and is ready, pour
the dose in quickly as far back as possible, taking
care not to spill the last drop on the lips. This
process may seem unduly troublesome, but when
castor oil is needed it is badly needed and efforts
to make it stay down are worth while. The following
method also effectually disguises the taste
of castor oil: place in a glass a teaspoonful
of baking soda, add the prescribed dose of oil
and then the juice of half a lemon. Mix all together
thoroughly and let the patient take the
mixture while it is effervescing. This method
may be used unless the patient is not allowed soda
and lemon juice. Castor oil may be bought
in capsules, but on account of their size many
people find the capsules impossible to swallow.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Suppositories.</h4><p>&mdash;Sometimes medicines are given
through the rectum. For this purpose they are
combined with cocoa butter or other material, and
made into small cones called suppositories. They
melt at a low temperature and should be kept on<!-- Page 210 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
ice until needed. A suppository should be lubricated
with vaseline, and inserted very gently as
far as the finger can be introduced, while the
patient is lying on the back or left side.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Enemata.</h4><p>&mdash;An injection of a fluid into the
rectum is called an enema. (Plural, enemas, or
enemata.) Enemas are generally used to cause
evacuation of the bowels.</p></div>

<p>For a simple purgative enema one of the following
is generally used: plain water; or a solution of
common salt in the proportion of one teaspoonful
of salt to one pint of water; or soap suds made
with a white soap such as castile or ivory. Unless
otherwise ordered the temperature of the enema
should be between 105¬∞ and 110¬∞ F.</p>

<p>To give an enema, one should proceed as follows:
First protect the bed by placing under the patient's
hips a rubber sheet, covered by a draw sheet
or large towel. Let the patient lie on the back,
with the knees flexed and head low. Bring to the
bedside a commode or bedpan, and lastly the solution
contained in a fountain syringe having a long
rubber tube, stopcock and short hard rubber
nozzle. The bag of the syringe may be hung on
the bed post or elsewhere, but it should not be
more than three feet at most above the patient's
head. Lubricate the nozzle with vaseline either
from a tube, or removed from a jar by means of a<!-- Page 211 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
piece of toilet paper; never dip the nozzle itself into
a vaseline jar. Let the solution flow into the bedpan
until it runs warm and smoothly; a jerky
flow means presence of air bubbles which cause
pain if injected into the bowels. Unless the
patient is able to do it herself, gently insert the
nozzle, and at the same time start the flow.
Force must not be used in inserting the nozzle,
and the flow should be gentle; if the solution
goes in rapidly the patient may be unable to
retain it. If there is a desire to expel the enema
as soon as the injection has begun, shut off the
current and wait a minute, meanwhile making
gentle pressure upon the patient's abdomen with
one hand; then lower the bag a little and begin
again. A grown person should take from two to
four pints, and a child from one to two pints.
After the enema is finished give the bedpan immediately;
the enema will, however, be more
effective if retained a few minutes. The bedpan
should be given and removed according to the
directions on <a href="#Page_176">page 176</a>. Sometimes an enema is
expelled with such violence that it soils the upper
sheet; to protect the covers a rubber sheet may be
spread over the patient's knees and legs. Since
an enema sometimes causes nausea or faintness, a
patient should be watched constantly during the
process.</p>

<p><!-- Page 212 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
To give an enema to a baby one may use a small
syringe having a soft rubber bulb with a nozzle
directly attached, or the ordinary fountain syringe
with the small, hard rubber tip designed for
infants. The enema should be given in a warm
room free from draughts, and the baby must be
warmly covered throughout the process. First
cover the lap with a pad or folded blanket. Upon
the blanket place a warmed rubber sheet, and over
the rubber a warm diaper. Hold the baby on
your lap, so that he lies on his back with his knees
drawn up. Hold his feet or legs firmly in your
left hand. Lubricate the nozzle thoroughly with
vaseline. Be sure that all the air is expelled from
the syringe, and then proceed as already directed.
A baby will take from two or three ounces up to
half a pint or even more, according to the size of
the child. After the injection is finished place a
small vessel under the baby's hips, and hold it
until the fluid has been expelled, keeping the child
well covered all the time.</p>

<p>After being used, the nozzle of a fountain
syringe should be washed with soap and water,
boiled, dried and put away in a clean place. Inserting
the nozzle into the bag of the syringe
immediately after withdrawing it from the rectum
is a filthy but not uncommon practice. The
syringe should be kept clean inside and out; it<!-- Page 213 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
should be washed in hot soapsuds, rinsed in clean
hot water, drained, and when thoroughly dry
wrapped in a clean towel or tissue paper. The
ordinary fountain syringe hanging for months by a
dirty string on a hook in the bath room is an unpleasant
and generally an unclean object.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sprays and Gargles.</h4><p>&mdash;Several other methods of
administering medicines are occasionally employed.
Some remedies may be applied directly to
the throat by gargles, and to the nose and throat
by sprays. The throat may be cleansed by
gargling with a solution of a teaspoonful of baking
soda or common salt in a glass of warm water.
Nose sprays should not be used except under
medical advice, and it is well to remember that if
the mouth washes, gargles, and sprays advertised
to be disinfectants were really strong enough to
kill germs, they would be too harsh for common
or continued use. The nozzles of nose and
throat sprays should be boiled immediately after
use. A surprising number of families who have progressed
far beyond common drinking cups and
towels, continue to use a common nose spray without
even washing the nozzle. Children while they
are well should be taught to gargle the throat;
a child with a sore throat and an aching head is
in a poor condition to learn anything.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Inhalation</h4>&nbsp;<p>or breathing in, is another method<!-- Page 214 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
used to introduce drugs into the membranes of the
nose, throat, and lungs. Smelling salts are an
example of substances used for inhalation; they
are used to stimulate persons who are faint. They
should not be placed close to the nostrils, nor used
at all when the patient is totally unconscious.</p></div>

<p>Inhalations of steam are often used in asthma,
croup, and bronchitis. Special croup kettles are
made for the purpose, but an ordinary pitcher
half full of boiling water may be used instead.
The patient's head should be held closely over the
pitcher, and a towel should be adjusted around the
top covering the patient's nose and mouth, but
admitting just enough air to make it possible for
him to breathe. If a drug is ordered it should be
added to the water.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Inunction</h4><p>, or rubbing a substance into the skin,
is sometimes ordered for delicate babies and children.
After the skin of the abdomen has been
washed with warm soapy water and thoroughly
dried, the substance ordered, generally olive oil or
cod liver oil, should be applied by means of a
circular movement of the palm of the hand. The
oil should be warm and the rubbing continued
until it is absorbed.</p></div>

<p>Ointments are also applied by inunction. A
small quantity at a time should be rubbed in,
using a circular motion. If an ointment is ordered<!-- Page 215 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to be applied where the skin is broken, the ointment
should be spread upon gauze and applied
without friction. Liniments are rubbed in in the
same way as ointments. In many cases rubbing
accomplishes more than the ointment or liniment
itself, so that this part of the treatment must not
be slighted.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Household Medicine Cupboard.</h4><p>&mdash;In every
household a small cupboard is needed for medical
and surgical supplies. Glass shelves are desirable,
because they show when dirty and are easily
cleaned, but a wooden cupboard can easily be lined
with clean paper or white enamel cloth held in
place with thumb tacks. Dirty, stained shelves
should not be tolerated. The cupboard should be
kept locked and the key put well out of the reach
of children. In the cupboard should be kept
medicines in daily use; they should not be paraded
on family dinner tables.</p></div>

<p>Poisonous drugs should have rough glass bottles
and conspicuous labels. All medicine bottles
should be kept well corked, since evaporation may
take place and the remaining solution, by becoming
stronger, may be dangerous to use in the
ordinary amount. Pills and tablets sometimes
deteriorate by standing, and may become so hard
that they pass through the stomach and intestines
without dissolving. It is best to buy drugs and<!-- Page 216 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
surgical supplies in small quantities; when it is
cheaper to buy more at a time the druggist should
be asked whether they will deteriorate or not.</p>

<p>Almost every family needs to keep on hand some
cathartics, some disinfectants, some material for
first aid, and a few simple appliances. Most
families have certain other needs peculiar to
themselves, and for those who live at a distance
from drug stores a greater quantity and variety
may be required. Elaborate equipment and extensive
supplies of medicines are neither economical
nor necessary for household use.</p>

<p>Castor oil, Rochelle or other laxative salts, and
two grain cascara tablets ordinarily constitute a
sufficient supply of cathartics. The dose of
castor oil is one or two teaspoonfuls for a baby up
to a tablespoonful for an adult. Rochelle salts
and seltzer aperient are given dissolved in water;
the ordinary dose is from one to four teaspoonfuls.
Seidlitz powders come in two packets, one white
and one blue. The contents of the packets
should first be dissolved in separate glasses each
filled about a quarter full of water. One solution
should then be poured into the other and the mixture
taken while it is effervescing. Cascara
tablets are generally given in one to ten grain
doses.</p>

<p>A small bottle of tincture of iodine and one of<!-- Page 217 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
70% alcohol should be kept for disinfecting.
Neither one is for internal use. The iodine is
used to disinfect small wounds and abrasions of
the skin. It is applied with cotton swabs and
several swabs should be made and kept on hand in
a box or envelope. Alcohol is used to disinfect
thermometers and other instruments that cannot
be boiled, for rubbing, and may also be used for disinfecting
the skin. A 90% solution is sometimes
used for rubbing; it need not be bought until
needed. Denatured and wood alcohol are poisons
and should be used in households only in
spirit lamps; they are not safe for other purposes.</p>

<p>First aid materials may include two gauze
bandages two and one-half inches wide and two
bandages one inch wide, one American Red Cross
First Aid Outfit, a small package of absorbent
cotton, a roll of old muslin, a package of adhesive
plaster one inch wide, boracic ointment, picric
acid gauze or other application for burns, safety
pins, and a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>For use in cases of fainting or exhaustion it is
well to keep aromatic spirits of ammonia on hand.
Its bottle should have a rubber stopper. The
dose is one-half to one teaspoonful, in a quarter to
half a glass of water. Hot coffee and tea are also
good stimulants, but the time necessary to prepare
them makes it desirable to have aromatic<!-- Page 218 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ammonia on hand. Household or ordinary ammonia
must not be used as a substitute.</p>

<p>Olive oil, mustard, and baking soda may be
brought from the kitchen when needed. It is
assumed that vaseline, cold cream, hand lotion,
talcum powder, and other toilet preparations will
also be available.</p>

<p>Only a few appliances are necessary. Among
them are a medicine glass, a teaspoon, clinical
thermometer, hot water bag, fountain syringe,
and an alcohol lamp in houses without gas or
electric stoves. It is better not to buy other
appliances until they are needed, particularly
rubber goods since they deteriorate rapidly.</p>

<br />
APPLICATION OF HEAT, COLD, AND
COUNTER-IRRITANTS</h2>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Inflammation.</h4><p>&mdash;A process called inflammation
sometimes occurs in tissues that have been injured
or invaded by bacteria. Although painful, it is
nevertheless one of the reparative processes of the
body, and therefore beneficial. Common examples
of inflammation are boils, sore throat, and the
swollen, painful condition resulting from sprains
and fractures. Characteristic symptoms of inflammation
are heat, redness, swelling, and pain.</p></div>

<p>When a tissue has been invaded by bacteria,
nearby blood vessels dilate, thus bringing an increased
supply of blood to the affected part.
This extra supply serves to wash away the offending
substance, and at the same time it brings
more white blood corpuscles, one function of
which is to destroy bacteria. From the increased
supply of blood the affected part becomes red and
hot, and so much blood may come that the vessels
further on are unable to carry it away fast
enough. Some of the fluid part of the blood is
then forced out into the tissues, and the part<!-- Page 221 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
becomes swollen. Distension of the tissues and
pressure on the nerve endings cause pain, and
the injured part now exhibits the characteristic
symptoms of inflammation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig21.png" width="300" height="260" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 21.&mdash;"The History of a Boil."</span> This figure represents
a cross-section of normal skin. Note the surface layer, or
cuticle, and the "true skin," or cutis. In the cutis one sees
that the blood capillaries are just wide enough for the blood-cells
to pass through "in single file." The skin has just been pricked
by a dirty pin. On the point of this pin were several poisonous
germs which were deposited at <i>a</i>. (<cite>From Emerson's "Essentials
of Medicine."</cite>)</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig22.png" width="300" height="284" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 22.&mdash;"The History of a Boil"</span> (continued). The poison
from these germs diffuses through the cutis. The capillaries
dilate. The leucocytes force their way through the walls
of the capillaries and travel towards these germs. Note the
dumb-bell shape of the leucocytes as they pass through the
minute holes in the capillary walls, and their pseudopods as they
travel towards their common destination, attracted by the
poison from the germs. The skin in this region is now swollen,
red, hot, and painful. (<cite>From Emerson's "Essentials of Medicine."</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>At this point, if the injury begins to heal or
the bacterial infection to yield, the extra blood
supply is gradually carried off, the blood vessels
resume their normal size, and the tissues return
to their usual condition. If, however, the infection
does not yield so quickly, more and more
white blood corpuscles assemble and pass through<!-- Page 222 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the walls of the tiny blood vessels into the tissues.
Here the struggle continues. Some bacteria and
some white blood corpuscles are killed, and substances
are formed which liquify these dead cells
and also some cells of the surrounding tissues.
The resulting fluid is called pus or matter, and
in the case of a boil we then say it has come to a
head. If the infection occurs near a cavity or
near the surface of the body, the pus may escape
by breaking through at the point of least resistance,
and may carry most of the poisons along<!-- Page 223 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with it. If the pus finds no outlet it may be
gradually absorbed by the blood stream, and healing
may result without discharging. On the other
hand, the germs may make their way into the
circulation, thus causing the serious condition
known as blood poisoning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig23.png" width="272" height="300" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 23.&mdash;"The History of a Boil"</span> (continued). The migration
of leucocytes has continued until now they form a dense
mass surrounding the germs. The poison of the germs has
killed all the leucocytes and also all the cutis immediately
around them, and now digestive fluids from the dead leucocytes
is turning the whole dead mass into liquid pus. The boil has
"come to a head." There is a little lump on the skin and
through its thin covering of cuticle can be seen the yellow pus.
(<cite>From Emerson's "Essentials of Medicine."</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>Inflammation may be treated by means of
hot applications, cold applications, or counter-irritants.
The effect of heat is to dilate the vessels
and hence to increase the flow of blood to the injured
part. This increased blood supply makes<!-- Page 224 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the reparative process go on more vigorously,
and also makes it possible for the accumulated
fluid to be more rapidly carried away. Moist
heat softens the tissues so that pus, if formed,
can escape more easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig24.png" width="294" height="300" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Fig. 24.&mdash;"The History of a Boil"</span> (concluded). The boil
has finally ruptured. The liquid pus has escaped carrying with
it the germs and most of their poisons; the migration of leucocytes
has stopped; the capillaries are returning to normal size
and now new tissue will grow and fill up this hole. (<cite>From
Emerson's "Essentials of Medicine."</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>Cold acts in just the opposite way. It decreases
the size of the blood vessels so that less
blood comes to cause pain and swelling; at the
same time it diminishes the number of white blood
corpuscles and the nutritive substance brought
by the blood. The nature and location of the
infection determine whether heat or cold is to be
preferred.</p>

<p><!-- Page 225 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Counter-irritants, of which mustard is an example,
have a complicated action. A counter-irritant
affects the blood circulation of the place
to which it is applied, and at the same time it
irritates the superficial nerves, which in turn
stimulate other more distant nerves. The latter
nerves control the circulation in tissues not
adjoining those to which the counter-irritant is
applied, and thus it is possible for a mustard
paste, for example, if applied at one point to bring
about changes in the blood supply of another
part of the body. The mechanism by which
counter-irritation is brought about is an intricate
nervous process called reflex action.</p>

<h3>HOT APPLICATIONS</h3>

<p>In applying either moist or dry heat the danger
of burning or scalding a patient must be constantly
kept in mind. This danger is always
great, but it is especially great when the skin is
tender like that of babies, children, and old people,
or when the vitality is low as in cases of chronic
or exhausting illness. Unfortunately accidents
in applying heat are not uncommon; a moment's
carelessness may cause serious injury and prolonged
suffering.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Dry Heat.</h4><p>&mdash;Hot water bags are used to apply<!-- Page 226 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
dry heat. They should be filled not more than
two-thirds full of hot water, but the water must not
be so hot that there is the slightest possibility of
scalding the patient if the bag should leak.
Boiling water should never be used. Before the
stopper is screwed on, expel the air by squeezing
the bag or by resting it upon a flat surface
until the water reaches the top. After closing
the bag make sure that both bag and stopper
are in order, by noting whether leakage occurs
when the bag is inverted and pressed moderately.
Before it is placed near the patient the bag should
be dried and entirely covered with a towel or
canton flannel bag.</p></div>

<p>Strong bottles, jugs, and jars, if they can be
securely stoppered, may be used sometimes
instead of hot water bags. The same precautions
are necessary. Bricks, flat irons, or thick flannel
bags containing salt or sand may be heated in
the oven and used in the same way. Salt and
sand retain heat for a long time, but are correspondingly
slow to heat; therefore one bag
should be heating in the oven while the other is
in use. Their effect on the skin must be no less
carefully watched than the effects of other hot
applications.</p>

<p>Hot dry flannel may be used without fear of
burning a patient, and it sometimes yields sufficient<!-- Page 227 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
warmth to relieve pain, particularly
abdominal pain of babies. After it has been
heated on a radiator or in an oven, it should be
applied quickly and covered closely with another
flannel to prevent escape of heat.</p>

<p>Dry heat can be applied conveniently by an
electric pad. The part to be heated may be
wrapped in flannel or placed directly above or
below the pad. The pad should be carefully
watched to see that the switch is not accidentally
turned, as it is possible for the pad to become hot
enough to burn the patient or to set fire to the
bed covers.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Moist Heat.</h4><p>&mdash;To apply moist heat poultices
or fomentations (stupes) are used.</p></div>

<p><i>Poultices</i> may be made of various heat-retaining
substances, but flaxseed meal is generally used.
The poultices when ready should be applied without
delay, therefore all preparations should be
made in advance. To prepare a poultice, first
provide a piece of gauze or thin old muslin about
two inches wider than you wish the poultice to be
when finished, and about two inches more than
twice as long. In a shallow saucepan boil water,
varying in amount according to the size of the
poultice desired; about equal parts of water and
meal will be needed. When the water is boiling
briskly add the meal gradually, beating constantly<!-- Page 228 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
with a spatula or knife. The poultice is done
when the mixture coheres and is thick enough
to drop from the spatula leaving it clean. Quickly
spread a layer of the hot flaxseed from a quarter
to half an inch thick on one-half of the muslin,
leaving a margin on three sides of about an inch
(Fig. 25). Fold in the margins of the cloth
(Fig. 26) and then bring the other half of the
cloth over the flaxseed so that the top of
the poultice is covered. Tuck the free end of the
upper half of the cloth under the turned in edges
of the long sides.</p>

</div>

<p>Carry the poultice on a hot plate, or rolled in<!-- Page 229 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a newspaper or hot towel. Test it carefully
with the back of the hand, apply it to the skin
gradually, cover it with cotton batting, oiled muslin,
or several thicknesses of flannel, and keep
it in place with a bandage or towel. Remove it
as soon as it has become cold, and unless the skin
is much reddened apply a fresh poultice. If
the skin is much reddened, anoint it with vaseline
or sweet oil, wrap it warmly, and apply the next
poultice as soon as the appearance of the skin
is normal.</p>

<p><i>Stupes</i> or <i>hot fomentations</i> are cloths, preferably
of flannel or flannelette, wrung out of
boiling water and applied to the skin. Each
stupe should be three or four times as large as
the area to be covered. Two are needed, so
that one may be prepared before removing the
other. To prevent escape of heat and moisture
the stupe should be covered after it has been
applied, first with a piece of rubber cloth or
oiled silk or muslin, and next with several
thicknesses of flannel, or cotton batting made
into a pad. The whole should be kept in place
with a bandage or towel used as a binder. The
doctor will tell how often the stupes are to be
applied, but if the skin becomes irritated they
must be stopped until its appearance is again
normal.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.&mdash;Wringing Stupe.</span> (<cite>From "Elementary Nursing Procedures,"
California State Board of Health.</cite>)</span>
</div>

<p>Great care must be taken in applying fomentations.
They do little good unless very hot,
but if applied too hot the patient is likely to
be scalded. They must be wrung as dry as possible;<!-- Page 231 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
but it is difficult to wring them without
scalding the hands unless stupe wringers are used.
Stupe wringers are heavy pieces of cloth, like
roller towels or pieces of ticking, long enough
to extend over opposite sides of the basin
in which the stupe is to be boiled, and wide
enough to hold the stupe easily. The wringer
should be placed in the basin with the stupe arranged
upon it. Boiling water should then be
added, or the water, stupe, and wringer may be
boiled together in the basin. After the stupe
is ready, the wringer with the stupe upon it
should be removed from the water by grasping
the dry ends of the wringer. Then the ends
should be twisted in opposite directions until the
stupe inside is as dry as possible. Wringing is
made easier if the wringer has wide hems into
which sticks such as pieces of broom handles are
inserted. By twisting the sticks in opposite
directions the stupe may be wrung out easily.</p>

<h3>COLD APPLICATIONS</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Dry Cold.</h4><p>&mdash;Cold, like heat, may be used either
dry or moist. Bags of rubber or of Japanese
paper filled with small pieces of ice are used to
apply dry cold. When weight is to be avoided,
the bag should not be completely filled. After
the bag has been filled and the air has been expelled,<!-- Page 232 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it should be stoppered securely and wrapped
in a towel or piece of flannel, since it is possible
for an uncovered ice bag to freeze the skin. Ice
bags are easily punctured, and care should be
taken not to bring pressure upon them especially
when filled with sharp pieces of ice. An ice bag
not in use should be thoroughly dry inside and
out; it should be put away with enough absorbent
cotton inside to keep the surfaces from adhering.
Bags of Japanese paper are less costly than rubber,
but less durable. To close them one should roll
the top over and then tie it tightly with string.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Moist Cold.</h4><p>&mdash;Cold compresses for the head are
often used for patients with fever or headache;
they sometimes quiet a patient who is restless. An
old handkerchief or piece of soft linen folded with
the raw edges inside may be used as a compress.
It should be large enough to cover the forehead.
Two compresses at least should be provided, and
a large piece of ice in a basin. One compress
should be wrung so that it will not drip, and then
applied to the head. The other meanwhile should
be placed on the ice to cool. As soon as the first
compress becomes warm, the second should be
applied in its place.</p></div>

<p><i>Cold Compresses for the Eyes.</i>&mdash;Soft material
should be selected for eye compresses. Each one
should be cut only a little larger than the eye and<!-- Page 233 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
should fit neatly over it. Several compresses
should be placed on a block of ice while one is
applied to the eye, and every few minutes the
compress should be changed. If there is discharge
from the eye, each compress should be used but
once; when used, they should be collected in a
paper and afterward burned. Separate compresses
should be used if both eyes are being treated.
Definite directions in regard to changing compresses
and the length of time the applications should
be continued are generally given by the physician.</p>

<h3>COUNTER-IRRITANTS</h3>

<p>To some extent all hot applications are counter-irritants,
but mustard pastes, mustard leaves, and
the mustard foot-bath already described are the
counter-irritants most commonly used.</p>

<p><i>Mustard Paste.</i>&mdash;To make a mustard paste, mix
dry mustard with flour, using for adults one part
of mustard and six of flour to make a weak paste;
increase the proportion of mustard up to equal
parts of mustard and flour, according to the
strength required. Use a smaller proportion of
mustard for children; one part of mustard with
from 6 to 10 parts of flour is generally enough.
Add to the mustard and flour enough tepid water
to make a paste, which must be absolutely free
from lumps. Do not use hot water for this<!-- Page 234 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
purpose, because it destroys some of the active
properties of the mustard. Spread the paste on
thin muslin, apply it to the skin, and remove it as
soon as the skin is reddened so that its color
resembles that of a strong sun-burn. If the
skin is especially sensitive, mix a little sweet oil
or vaseline with the paste.</p>

<p><i>Mustard leaves</i> should be dipped in tepid water
and may then be applied to the skin directly,
but if specially sensitive, the skin should be protected
by thin muslin or gauze. The leaf should
remain until the skin is well reddened; a few minutes
are generally sufficient.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to leave either a mustard
leaf or a paste in place long enough to blister
the skin. After the application has been removed;
the part should be protected by a soft cloth until
redness disappears. Vaseline or sweet oil should
be applied to the skin if it is greatly irritated.</p>

<p>Other counter-irritants in common use are
iodine, turpentine, ammonia, kerosene, camphorated
oil, capsicum vaseline, and various liniments.
Tincture of iodine may be diluted with alcohol
for especially sensitive skins; it sometimes causes
blisters, and should not be applied more than once
a day at most. Ammonia and turpentine cause
blisters; they should not be used as counter-irritants
except by a doctor's order, and then<!-- Page 235 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
only after exact directions have been obtained.
Turpentine and kerosene are inflammable and
hence dangerous to use. It should be remembered
that the action of all counter-irritants is
physiologically the same, so that no advantage is
obtained from the use of dangerous substances
like kerosene and turpentine.</p>

<br />
CARE OF PATIENTS WITH COMMUNICABLE
DISEASES</h2>

<p>The first chapter of this book described the
ways in which communicable diseases are carried
from person to person, and also some principles
underlying methods of prevention. This chapter
aims to show how these principles apply in
the actual care of patients whose diseases are
transmissible. In order to apply them intelligently,
it is necessary to keep in mind certain
facts in regard to the transmission of infections.
A brief summary of these facts follows.</p>

<p>Disease germs are present in the bodies of
persons suffering from communicable disease,
but they may also exist in the bodies of persons
in good health; if present in the body, they may
leave it in any bodily discharge. While every
kind of germ does not leave the body by all the
different routes, it is nevertheless true that most
germs expelled from the body are carried in discharges
from the nose, throat, bladder or bowels.
Germ-laden discharges of an infected person may<!-- Page 237 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
be distributed to other persons by water, milk
and other foods, by certain insects, by unclean
hands, by common drinking cups, towels, handkerchiefs,
and similar articles, and directly by nose
and throat spray. After they have been thus conveyed
to other persons, the germs make their entrance
into the body of their new victims through
the digestive tract, through the nose, throat, and
other mucous membranes, or through breaks in
the skin. Prevention of communicable diseases,
therefore, depends upon the measure of success
attained in blocking the transit of germs from
person to person; but methods of prevention,
though easy to understand, are unfortunately
sometimes difficult to carry out. In order to
carry them out effectively one must devote to the
problem great accuracy, unremitting care, considerable
intelligence, and a highly developed
conscience.</p>

<p>Care of a patient suffering from transmissible
disease is adequate only when it accomplishes
two definite results. One result, which concerns
the patient primarily, is to bring about his recovery
as rapidly and as surely as possible; the
other result, which concerns the community
rather than the individual, is to make it impossible
for the patient to infect others with his disease.
In every case of communicable disease, from a<!-- Page 238 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
slight cold in the head up to serious cases of pneumonia
or typhoid fever, both the patient and the
community must be constantly safe-guarded.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Incubation Period.</h4><p>&mdash;The interval between the
moment when pathogenic germs enter the body,
and the time when symptoms first appear and
the patient begins to feel ill, is called the incubation
period. Incubation periods vary according
to the disease from a few hours to two or
three weeks. The length of the period also varies
somewhat in different cases of the same disease.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of Patients with Colds or Other Slight
Infections.</h4><p>&mdash;The usual symptoms of infectious
diseases include fever, chill, sore throat, nasal
discharge, cough, headache, vomiting and other
digestive disturbances, and a general feeling of
being sick all over. When one or more of these
symptoms appear, unless they are very slight,
a doctor should be sent for. The patient, whether
child or grown person, should go to bed in a room
alone and should stay in bed at least as long as
the fever and symptoms of cold in the head
continue, in order to protect others as well as
himself. Persons in active life, it is true, are not
always able to go to bed during colds; but there
is no doubt that ultimately they would save
time by doing so. It is especially necessary for
children to remain in bed when suffering from<!-- Page 239 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
colds, not only to insure their own well-being
but also to protect others, since children are notably
careless in regard to coughing, sneezing, and
borrowing handkerchiefs. The patient needs mental
rest as well as physical, and should not be allowed
to work in bed.</p></div>

<p>The patient's nose and throat discharges
should be received only in material that can be
burned, like old linen or muslin, gauze, or paper
napkins. As soon as they are soiled these handkerchief
substitutes should be placed in strong
paper bags and afterward burned. Soiled handkerchiefs
lurking under pillows or in other parts
of the bed may infect other people or re-infect
the patient. Handkerchiefs that may not be
burned should be placed as soon as soiled in a
covered receptacle filled with cold water containing
a little washing soda; when several have
been collected they should be boiled in the same
covered receptacle for 20 minutes. After boiling
they may go to the regular laundry.</p>

<p>The patient's diet at first should be liquid
or semi-solid. Large amounts of nourishment
are not necessary during the first day or two,
especially if the illness is likely to be short,
but water should be taken as freely as possible.
Cold drinks are generally acceptable during the
feverish stage, but lemonade and other acids<!-- Page 240 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
should be used with caution, since they sometimes
irritate a sore throat. When the active
symptoms have subsided the patient will need
more food than usual, and a liberal, nourishing
diet for a few days will do much to prevent the
weakness and depressed vitality that often follow
colds, tonsilitis, and other comparatively
slight infections.</p>

<p>The bowels should be carefully regulated, and
a mild cathartic is often beneficial at the outset.</p>

<p>Even during slight illness a patient should receive
the daily care already described, and should
be made as comfortable as possible. As in any
illness, sponging and alcohol rubs are refreshing.
An ice bag or cold compress may relieve headache,
and hot applications or a cold compress on the
throat are often soothing. The throat may be
gargled with a solution of one teaspoonful of
common salt dissolved in a pint of boiled water.
If the patient perspires profusely he should be
rubbed with a towel until dry, and provided
with fresh warm, night clothes. An alcohol rub
may well follow. It is most unwise for a patient
who is perspiring freely to get up in a cold room
and attend to himself.</p>

<p>Common colds are far more serious than
they are usually supposed to be.</p>

<p><!-- Page 241 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"More people suffer from common colds than from
any other single ailment.... Could the sum total
of suffering, inconvenience, sequel√¶, and economic loss
resulting from common colds be obtained, it would at once
promote these infections from the trivial into the rank of
the serious diseases.... Colds are contracted from
other persons having colds, just as diphtheria is contracted
from diphtheria. Arctic explorers exposed to all the conditions
ordinarily supposed to produce colds do not suffer
from these ailments until they return to civilization and
become infected by contact with their fellowmen....
While common colds are never fatal, the complications
and sequel√¶ are serious. These are rheumatic fever,
pneumonia, sinusitis, nephritis, and a depressed vitality
which favors other infections and hastens the progress of
organic diseases.</p>

<p>"Common colds are perhaps most contagious during the
early stages. If persons isolate themselves by remaining
in bed during the first three days of a cold, they would
not only benefit themselves, but would largely prevent
the spread of the infection. The contagiousness and
severity of colds differ in different epidemics and in different
seasons of the year, depending upon the particular
micro-organism involved and other factors not well
understood.</p>

<p>"<b>Prevention.</b>&mdash;The prevention of colds consists, first
in avoiding the infection, and, secondly, in guarding against
the predisposing causes. Contact should be avoided with
persons who have colds, especially in street cars, offices,
and other poorly ventilated spaces where the risk of
persons coughing or sneezing directly in one's face is imminent.
Contact with the infection may further be
guarded against by a careful self-education in sanitary<!-- Page 242 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
habits and cleanliness, based upon the modern conception
of contact infection.</p>

<p>"Colds, like other diseases conveyed in the secretions
from the nose and mouth, are often conveyed by direct and
indirect contact through lack of hygienic cleanliness and a
disregard of sanitary habits. Kissing, the common drinking
cup, the roller towel, pipes, toys, pencils, fingers, food,
and other objects contaminated with the fresh secretions
will transmit the disease."&mdash;("Preventive Medicine and
Hygiene," Rosenau.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care During More Serious Infections.</h4><p>&mdash;When
a patient is suffering from serious transmissible
disease, he needs the most skillful care available,
and for the sake of others he must be strictly
isolated or quarantined. By isolating or quarantining
a patient is meant making such arrangements
that germs expelled by the patient are
necessarily destroyed before they can enter the
body of another person. Isolation, therefore,
includes disinfection, and while methods vary
according to the nature of the particular disease,
yet the principles given below are applicable in
most cases.</p></div>

<p>The first essential is that the patient should
have a room to himself. No one except those
caring for him should enter the sick-room for
any purpose whatever; visitors should be rigidly
excluded. At the outset all unnecessary articles
should be removed from the sick-room, and it<!-- Page 243 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
should be possible to boil, burn, scrub, or otherwise
thoroughly clean everything allowed to
remain. The windows should be screened in
summer, and flies must be excluded. Fresh air is
especially needed by patients with communicable
diseases, and ventilation of the room must be
adequate both day and night. Foul odors plainly
indicate that the patient or something in the
room is not clean. The remedy is obvious and
deodorants are quite unnecessary if the patient
and the room are properly cared for. It is highly
desirable to reserve a bath room for the exclusive
use of the patient and his attendant and also to
reserve a room adjoining the patient's room for
the exclusive use of the attendant. When it is
impossible, as it often is, to give up so much
space, each family must make the best arrangement
it can to separate the patient and his attendant
from the rest of the family.</p>

<p>The attendant must remember that her ten
fingers are the ten most active agents in distributing
the communicable diseases. After handling the
patient or anything that the patient has touched,
and whenever she leaves the patient's room, she
must scrub her hands thoroughly with warm water,
soap, and a nail brush. She should not soil her
hands unnecessarily, even though she intends to
scrub them later. She must remember for her<!-- Page 244 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
own protection to keep her hands away from her
mouth and face, and to cleanse them with special
care just before eating. If disinfection is needed
in addition to the scrubbing, she must use conscientiously
whatever solution the doctor orders.</p>

<p>At the same time that she is caring for a patient
with a communicable disease, the attendant
ought not to care for children or other members of
the family, she ought not to prepare food, and she
ought not to handle dishes or utensils used by
other persons. Every day, however, many women
are doing just these things, and it is true that in
many instances no bad results are observed. Yet
if any arrangement to insure safety can possibly
be made, it is inexcusable to run the risk of spreading
diseases which kill thousands of persons every
year and injure many more for life.</p>

<p>When home conditions render adequate care
and strict isolation of the patient impossible, hospital
care should be seriously considered. No
personal or sentimental objections should be allowed
to influence the decision, if removing the
patient to a hospital is necessary to safeguard his
welfare or the welfare of the family. Hospital
care should be considered especially for patients
with typhoid fever, because untrained persons
cannot safely care for patients so seriously ill.
Since a patient with typhoid needs skilled care,<!-- Page 245 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and since he greatly endangers other persons,
most authorities consider hospital care essential
unless the patient can have the continuous
services of a trained nurse and almost ideal home
conditions. Many cases of typhoid, it is true,
are successfully nursed at home in extremely
adverse conditions by visiting nurses; yet in few
kinds of sickness is continuous care by a graduate
nurse more necessary to protect the community as
well as to safeguard the patient himself.</p>

<p>Members of a family in which there is typhoid
should be immunized if the doctor advises it.
This process, which is performed by the doctor,
in the majority of cases renders a person immune
to typhoid fever for three or four years.</p>

<p>The question of home or institutional care for
persons with tuberculosis must also be carefully
considered. In some cases tuberculosis may be
cared for at home with comparative safety, and
in some other cases the risk is not very great if
the patient is intelligent, careful, and well supervised.
But everyone should face the fact
that all cases of tuberculosis of the lungs involve
some risk to others in the family, and most cases
involve great risk. The danger to children is
greater than to adults. Most tuberculosis infections,
it is now believed, are acquired in childhood.
The bad results of an infection acquired<!-- Page 246 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in childhood may not show themselves for years,
since the germs may remain inactive until the
person's resistance is lowered by some unfavorable
condition.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>The Children's Diseases.</h4><p>&mdash;The so-called children's
diseases are probably the most familiar
and the least regarded of all those belonging to
the communicable group. Most persons, it is
true, realize that scarlet fever is serious; everyone
should also realize that measles and whooping-cough
are serious. For example, in the State of
New York during the year 1916, more children
died from each of these diseases than from scarlet
fever: in that year 745, or four times the number
that died of scarlet fever, lost their lives from
whooping-cough, while 913 died of measles.
If diseases that kill hundreds of children every
year are not serious, one is at a loss to know
what a serious disease is.</p></div>

<p>Some parents even expose children unnecessarily
to these infections on the fatalistic theory
that they must have the diseases sometime,
and therefore the sooner the better. Nothing
could be more mistaken; the diseases are not
inevitable, and there is no advantage whatever
in having them if escape is possible. Moreover,
serious as the children's diseases are in themselves,
their after-effects may be even more serious. At<!-- Page 247 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
this very moment hundreds of people are going
through life handicapped by weakened hearts or
kidneys, by defective sight or hearing, merely
because their parents considered the children's
diseases necessary. The common belief that
children should have these diseases as early as
possible is also erroneous, since statistics show
that the younger the child the more likely is
the disease to prove fatal.</p>

<p>Every mother should realize that the children's
diseases are most infectious in the early stages.
Early symptoms include fever, sore throat, and
nasal discharge, and the trouble at first often resembles
a severe cold. During this stage the
diseases are most easily communicated. Measles
in particular is generally not recognized until its
most infectious stage has passed. The moral
to be drawn is that sore throats, coughs, and colds
should never be regarded lightly, and that their
spread should be prevented by all possible means.</p>

<p>The accompanying table taken from the regulations
of the New York State Department of
Health, gives symptoms of communicable diseases
among children, and rules for isolation and
exclusion from school.</p>

<p class="table-link">[<a href="redcross-table.html">Click to View Table</a>]</p>

<p>It may be added that the ways by which poliomyelitis,
or infantile paralysis, is spread are not
definitely known at the time of writing. We<!-- Page 248 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
are justified, however, in believing that investigation
now in progress will make exact information
available in the near future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The weight of present opinion inclines to the view that
poliomyelitis is exclusively a human disease, and is spread
by personal contact, whatever other causes may be found
to contribute to its spread. In personal contact we mean to
include all the usual opportunities, direct or indirect, immediate
or intermediate, for the transference of body discharges from
person to person, having in mind as a possibility that the
infection may occur through contaminated food.</p>

<p>"The incubation period has not been definitely established
in human beings. The information at hand indicates
that it is less than two weeks, and probably in the
great majority of cases between 3 and 8 days."&mdash;(Report
of Special Committee on Infantile Paralysis, American
Journal of Public Health, November 1916.)</p></blockquote>

<h3>DISINFECTION</h3>

<p>Specific directions for disinfecting in every kind
of communicable disease would be too extended
to be given here. In each case the attendant
should learn from the doctor just how that particular
disease is communicated, just what discharges,
utensils, linen, etc., need to be disinfected,
and just what disinfectants he prefers to have
used. The following general methods are now in
use, but it must be remembered that from time to
time new methods are devised and new disinfectants
are discovered.</p>

<p><!-- Page 249 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of Nose and Throat Discharges.</h4><p>&mdash;The care
of handkerchiefs has already been described on
<a href="#Page_239">page 239</a>. Cloths or cotton used to wipe the eyes
or to receive any other bodily discharge including
vomitus, should be collected in the same way and
burned. Everyone should be taught in early
childhood to cover the nose and mouth with a
handkerchief during coughing and sneezing; if the
patient has not already learned to do so he must
be taught now. If the amount of expectoration is
great, waterproof receptacles should be provided,
which should be burned with their contents.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of Discharges from the Bowels and Bladder.</h4><p>&mdash;At
the present time the following preparations
are commonly used to disinfect stools and
urine: 5% solution of carbolic acid; chloride
of lime solution, made freshly whenever needed
by mixing thoroughly ¬Ω pound of chloride of lime
with one gallon of water; and unslaked lime to
which is added <em>hot</em> water. The amount of carbolic
solution used should be about equal in bulk
to the amount of material to be disinfected; the
chloride of lime solution should be at least twice,
and the unslaked lime at least one-eighth the bulk.
Fecal masses should be broken up so that the disinfectant
may reach every part; they may be
stirred with tightly twisted toilet paper, which
should be left in the bedpan and disinfected with<!-- Page 250 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the stools. If these substances are used, disinfection
is considered complete at the end of an hour,
and the contents of the bedpan may then be
emptied into the toilet with safety. It may be
necessary to provide two bedpans so that one
may be available for use while the contents of the
other is being disinfected. Bedpans and urinals
should be boiled daily and kept thoroughly clean
at all times.</p></div>

<p>In places having no sewerage system, disinfected
discharges may be emptied into a trench
situated at a distance from the well, and then
covered with earth. As an extra precaution, the
disinfected discharges may be mixed with sawdust
or kerosene and burned in the trench. Directions
for installing a sanitary privy may be found in
Bulletin 68 of the United States Public Health
Service.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bath water</h4>&nbsp;<p>and water that has been used for
cleansing the teeth and mouth may be disinfected
in the same way as urine, or it may be emptied
into a suitable receptacle and boiled ten minutes.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of the Hands.</h4><p>&mdash;Disinfectants for the
hands should be used in addition to scrubbing
with soap and water, not as a substitute. The
hands may be disinfected after scrubbing by soaking
them for three minutes in one of the following
solutions: alcohol 70%, carbolic acid solution<!-- Page 251 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
2¬Ω%, or a solution made by adding one teaspoonful
of lysol or of creolin to a pint of water. These
disinfectants are poisons if taken internally; the
bottles must be carefully labeled and kept in a
safe place. It is a good plan to wear rubber gloves
when handling infective material; the gloves
should afterward be boiled for ten minutes.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of Utensils.</h4><p>&mdash;A sufficient number of dishes,
spoons, tumblers, basins, etc. must be reserved for
the patient's exclusive use; these utensils must be
washed separately and dried with towels not used
for other dishes. Mistakes frequently occur by
which other persons use the patient's dishes, and in
consequence his dishes should not be kept in the
cupboard with other dishes; if no other safe place
can be found, they had better stay in the patient's
room covered with a clean cloth or napkin. The
dishes should be scalded daily and at the termination
of the illness they must be boiled briskly for
ten minutes before they are returned to general use.
Food left on the patient's tray should be burned;
it should not be eaten by any one else, nor placed
in the pantry or refrigerator with other food.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Care of Linen.</h4><p>&mdash;A satisfactory way to disinfect
towels, night gowns, bed linen, etc. is to place the
articles immediately in a wash boiler filled with
cold water to which a little washing soda has been
added, and then to boil them in the same water for<!-- Page 252 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
twenty minutes; they can afterward go safely into
the regular laundry. The boiling may be done
once a day; articles soiled in the meantime may be
left to soak in the cold water and soda.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Disinfection of the Person.</h4><p>&mdash;"The cleansing
and disinfection of the person includes washing
the entire body and the hair with soap and water;
thorough brushing of the teeth; rinsing the mouth;
gargling the throat, and douching and spraying
the nose with an antiseptic solution; and finally,
a complete change of clothing (or a change of
underwear) and a thorough shaking and brushing
of the outer garments out-of-doors before these
are put on again."&mdash;(New York State Department
of Health.)</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Termination of Quarantine.</h4><p>&mdash;After the patient
has recovered, he and the attendant should,
if the doctor thinks it necessary, disinfect themselves
as directed above before they mingle again
with other people. The exact time when it is
safe for a person to come out of quarantine and
resume ordinary life varies in different diseases.
Moreover, opinion differs in regard to quarantine
periods for the same diseases, so that the regulations
of Boards of Health in different cities
show wide variations. It is of course impossible
to say at just what moment every patient, or
even the majority of patients, will stop expelling<!-- Page 253 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
germs. Quarantine periods are intended to protect
the community as completely as possible
without causing unnecessary hardship to individuals.
In any given case, the local regulations
should be strictly observed but release from
quarantine is not a guarantee that the patient
is not still discharging germs, and extreme care
should still be taken to prevent the spread of
saliva and other discharges.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Terminal Disinfection.</h4><p>&mdash;A room that has been
occupied by a patient with a communicable
disease should be thoroughly cleaned at the
termination of the illness. Dishes, utensils,
bed linen, etc. should be cared for in the ways
already described. The floor, bedstead, and other
furniture should be washed with hot water,
soap, and washing soda. The walls, windows,
etc., should be wiped with a cloth wrung out of
hot water, soap suds, and soda. The mattress,
unless badly soiled with discharges, should be
scrubbed with the same solution and a stiff
brush, and left out-of-doors in the sunshine
for a day or two, or until dry. If badly soiled, it is
best to destroy the mattress unless the Board of
Health has facilities for steam sterilization. Ordinary
washing is all that is generally required for
blankets, but if badly soiled they should be
sterilized by steam or burned. The room should<!-- Page 254 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
then be thoroughly sunned and aired for a day
or two, with the windows wide open both day
and night. Sunning and airing are among the
most important measures in disinfecting a room,
and should not be slighted. If there has been
gross pollution, as when a careless consumptive
persists in spitting on the floor and walls, it may
be necessary to remove the old paint and paper
and have the room done over. The room may
safely be occupied after all these measures have
been taken.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Fumigation.</h4><p>&mdash;Many Boards of Health have
abandoned fumigation after communicable diseases,
except after those which like typhus and
yellow fever, are carried by vermin or insects.
Dry formaldehyde gas, which was formerly used
for fumigation, has a violent effect on mucous
membranes, but its power to kill bacteria, even
on surfaces, appears to be weak, while its penetrating
power is not sufficient to disinfect bedding,
carpets, upholstered furniture, and other fabrics.
Since fumigation is costly, troublesome, and
ineffectual there seems to be no good reason for
using it. Moreover, its use gives a false sense
of security, so that really effective measures
like sunning, airing, and scrubbing are likely
to be neglected.</p></div>

<p>Theory and practice of disinfection, it is clear,<!-- Page 255 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
have radically changed in recent years. Modern
knowledge requires concurrent disinfection, or
the destruction of germs from the moment when
symptoms are first noticed; all the time, day and
night, this disinfection must go on with unremitting
care. Today wet sheets are not hung in
doorways nor are chemicals left about in open
dishes to disinfect quite harmless air, but
scrupulous cleanliness at all stages of disease is
recognized as one of the most important measures,
if not the most important measure, in disinfection.</p>

COMMON AILMENTS AND EMERGENCIES</h2>

<p>This chapter describes a few home treatments
for the relief of slight ailments and injuries,
together with some measures that may be employed
in emergencies. For more extended instructions
in these subjects the student should
consult the Red Cross Text-book on First Aid.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM IS INVOLVED</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Headache.</h4><p>&mdash;Headache is not a disease in itself,
but a symptom common to many different disorders.
Among the abnormal conditions often
causing headaches are fatigue, eyestrain, indigestion,
constipation, neuralgia, rheumatism, an√¶mia,
acute infections, and other disorders. Treatment
should consist in finding the cause and removing
it if possible; clearly no one remedy can
cure so many different causes. A physician
should be consulted if headaches are of frequent
occurrence, but in many cases rest and attention<!-- Page 258 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to other hygienic requirements are all that is
needed. During an attack of headache a hot
foot bath may give relief, or a mustard paste or
cold applications on the back of the neck, or an
ice bag or cold compress on the forehead.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sleeplessness</h4><p>, like headache, has many possible
causes, and effective treatment consists in
finding and removing them. Pain or discomfort
of any kind, fatigue, overwork, and worry are
common causes. Sleeplessness easily becomes
a habit that may persist after its cause has
been removed; hence a person who has formed the
habit of sleeplessness should patiently strive to
break the old habit and to substitute a better.
A careful hygienic r√©gime is essential for the patient,
exercise in the open air, and cultivation of
a hopeful and tranquil spirit. The diet should be
liberal, but light and unstimulating; tea and coffee
should be omitted, certainly during the latter
part of the day. The patient should spend rather
a dull evening, avoiding excitement and mental
exertion that is difficult, even though pleasurable.
He should retire early. A hot tub or foot bath,
and a hot drink at bed time may help to produce
sleep. The bedroom should be dark, cool, and
well ventilated, the bed comfortable and the covers
light but warm. The patient should be told
that rest is the most important thing for him,<!-- Page 259 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and that he should not try too hard to sleep nor
worry if unsuccessful. The patient should try
to banish from his mind, at bed time, thoughts
that are distressing, and even those that are
especially interesting. By using patience and
persistence most persons can regain the power of
sleeping even when habits of sleeplessness have
been long established.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Fainting</h4>&nbsp;<p>is a partial or total loss of consciousness
due to a diminished supply of blood in the
brain. It may follow bleeding, exhaustion from
heat, fatigue from prolonged standing and the
like, or strong emotional disturbance, like fear
or surprise. Fainting is less common than it
formerly was; it now occurs most frequently
among persons suffering from an√¶mia, heart
weakness, or special susceptibility.</p></div>

<p>Symptoms of fainting are pale face, cold perspiration,
rapid, feeble pulse, and shallow, sighing
respiration. Treatment consists in removing
the patient into cool, fresh air, applying cold
water to the face and keeping the head low. For
a person who feels faint but has not lost consciousness,
this treatment will probably prove sufficient;
if, however, he becomes unconscious, place him
so that the head is lower than the body, loosen
the clothing, especially the clothing about the
neck, apply cold water to the face and chest, and<!-- Page 260 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
see that fresh air is plentiful. When the patient
is sufficiently conscious to swallow, give a teaspoonful
of aromatic spirits of ammonia in half a
glass of water and keep him quiet until he has
entirely recovered.</p>

<p>A person who is unconscious from any cause
always requires immediate attention. In emergency
work elevate the patient's head if his face
is flushed, and keep it low if his face is pale. Do
not try to arouse an unconscious patient by shaking
him and calling to him, in the first place because
it is useless to do so, and in the second, because
consciousness will return spontaneously
if his condition improves.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Convulsions.</h4><p>&mdash;In every case of convulsions
a doctor is needed at the earliest possible moment.
Convulsions in adults are very serious; in babies
and small children although serious they are less
alarming, since they may follow comparatively
slight disturbances, particularly disturbances of
digestion.</p></div>

<p>Treatment for babies and children with convulsions
consists first in keeping the child as quiet
as possible, and next in measures to draw blood
from the brain toward the surface of the body.
The child should first be undressed, moving him
as little as possible, and put to bed between
warm blankets. Cold should be applied to his<!-- Page 261 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
head by a compress or ice bag, and hot water
bag should be placed near his feet. An enema
should then be given. A warm tub bath is sometimes
used to apply heat, if the convulsion has
not subsided by the time the child is undressed.
If the bath is given the temperature of the water
should not be above 106¬∞, and should be tested
by a thermometer. If no thermometer is available,
the water should be tested with the elbow
rather than the hand, and cold water should be
added if it feels uncomfortably warm. There
is great danger of scalding a child during the excitement
inevitably caused by a convulsion.</p>

<p>Although haste is needed when a child has convulsions,
yet quiet is essential, since the slightest
movement tends to increase the convulsions
or to start them again. As soon as the convulsions
are over the child should be removed from
the bath and put to bed between warm blankets.
Even after the symptoms have completely subsided,
the greatest care should be taken to keep
the child quiet. He should be handled and disturbed
as little as possible. The bath should be
repeated if convulsions begin again. The doctor,
when he comes, will probably order a dose of
castor oil; and therefore, if it is impossible to
obtain a doctor at once, the dose should be given.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Shock</h4>&nbsp;<p>(in the medical sense of the word) or<!-- Page 262 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<i>collapse</i>, is a serious condition in which a patient's
vitality and all his bodily processes are profoundly
depressed. Generally shock occurs only after a
severe injury or a long exhausting illness. Since,
however, some persons are peculiarly susceptible
to it, the possibility of shock must be kept in mind
in treating even slight injuries. The probability
of shock is somewhat increased if patients are
allowed to see their own wounds. Injured persons
should always sit or lie down while wounds,
however slight, are dressed.</p></div>

<p>Symptoms of shock are pallor, pinched, anxious
expression, dilated pupils, cold clammy skin,
feeble breathing, and rapid, weak pulse. The
patient may be mentally normal, or irrational, or
unconscious, but more frequently he appears
stupid, and though conscious, he pays no attention
to what is going on. Unfortunately this condition
is sometimes mistaken for sleepiness, and he is
left alone to sleep just when active measures are
most needed.</p>

<p>If a patient shows any symptom of shock the
doctor should be summoned immediately, but no
time should be lost in beginning treatment, since
the condition may be critical. It should be remembered,
however, that panic and confusion
may alarm a patient who is conscious, and thus increase
the shock. The patient should be covered<!-- Page 263 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
warmly, and undressed under blankets, without
exposure or avoidable moving. His head should
be low, and as quickly as possible hot water bags
should be placed near but not upon him. If the
patient is conscious and able to swallow he should
be given hot coffee or aromatic spirits of ammonia,
one teaspoonful in half a glass of water. The
legs and arms should be rubbed from the extremities
toward the heart, but care should be
taken to avoid touching or moving injured parts.
The patient should stay in bed, warmly covered
and closely watched for some time after he has
apparently recovered.</p>

<p>Helping a patient into bed is not necessarily
the first thing to be done in every case of sudden
illness. Great harm may be done by the injudicious
moving of injured persons, and often it is
safer to make a person comfortable with pillows
and blankets where he happens to be, certainly
until a sufficient number of people can be found
to lift him properly. Clothing should be removed
carefully, and one should not hesitate to cut it
away if undressing is painful or necessitates much
moving.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Stimulants</h4><p>, in emergency work, are frequently
misused. They should not be given when the
head has been injured, when bleeding is profuse,
or when the face is red and the pulse strong.<!-- Page 264 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Neither should attempts be made to give fluids of
any kind to patients not sufficiently conscious to
swallow. Safe stimulants to use are black coffee,
tea, or aromatic spirits of ammonia. Alcoholic
liquors should not be given unless prescribed by a
physician.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sunstroke and heat exhaustion</h4>&nbsp;<p>are both caused
by excessive heat either indoors or out, but they
differ both in symptoms and in treatment.</p></div>

<p>Sunstroke or heat stroke, usually begins with
acute pain in the head, followed almost immediately
by loss of consciousness. The skin is dry
and very hot, the face is red or purple, the pupils
are dilated, the breathing is difficult, the pulse is
slow, and the temperature high.</p>

<p>Treatment consists in sending for the doctor,
removing the patient to a cool place, undressing
him and applying cold, especially to the head and
spine, or still better, placing him in a very cold
bath. The body should be rubbed constantly
in the direction of the heart. Stimulants should
not be given.</p>

<p>Symptoms of heat exhaustion, on the other hand,
resemble those of shock. The doctor should be
summoned, and the patient should be removed
to a cool and quiet place, where he should stay
warmly covered in a reclining position. Stimulants
should be given, hot water bags applied, and<!-- Page 265 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the other measures for treating shock should be
employed.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE DIGESTIVE
TRACT IS AFFECTED</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Nausea and vomiting</h4>&nbsp;<p>are frequently caused by
injudicious eating, especially when a person is
worried or fatigued. A doctor should be consulted
if either one occurs often, or if vomiting is accompanied
by pain, prostration, diarrh≈ìa, fever, or
other acute symptoms. A person who is nauseated
should lie down in a cool, quiet place. Hot
fomentations may be applied to the abdomen, or a
mustard paste over the stomach. Soda mints or a
teaspoonful of baking soda may be given dissolved
in hot water, and unless diarrh≈ìa is present a
Seidlitz powder or other saline cathartic may be
given. A large quantity of warm water may be
given to wash out the stomach; it is more effectual
if salt or mustard is added, in the proportion of one
teaspoonful to a glass of water.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Hiccough</h4><p>, which is usually caused by digestive
disturbances, is not serious in healthy people, and
can generally be stopped by holding the breath, or
by drinking water. If these measures are not
effectual, salt or mustard in water as already
described or a teaspoonful of the syrup of ipecac,
may be given to produce vomiting. If the hiccough<!-- Page 266 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
still continues, medical advice should be
obtained.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Diarrh≈ìa</h4>&nbsp;<p>is ordinarily caused by an infection,
or by an offending substance in the intestines.
The offending substance should be removed before
attempts are made to check the diarrh≈ìa. When
a baby has diarrh≈ìa four things should be done&mdash;all
food should be withheld; boiled water should be
given freely; bowel movements should be saved
for the doctor to see; and unless a doctor can be
found immediately, castor oil should be given,
from one-half to one teaspoonful according to the
age of the child. Similar treatment should be
given to older children. Adults should take one
tablespoonful of castor oil and drink boiled water
freely, but they should take no food until the
doctor comes.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Constipation</h4>&nbsp;<p>has been discussed on pages <a href="#Page_193">193</a>
and <a href="#Page_52">52</a>.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Colic</h4>&nbsp;<p>is a sharp, intermittent pain in the abdominal
region; it is caused in many instances by indigestion
or chilling. The following remedies may
relieve it: a hot water bag, an emetic, as salt or
mustard in luke-warm water, a Seidlitz powder or
other saline cathartic, soda mints, or a teaspoonful
of syrup of ginger in hot water. Unless it feels
sore or tender, the abdomen may be rubbed up, on
the right side, across, just below the waist, and<!-- Page 267 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
down, on the left side. Babies may be given a few
teaspoonfuls of warm water, or an enema of salt
and water.</p></div>

<p>Colic may be serious. The doctor should be
summoned at once if the patient seems exhausted,
if the pain is severe, if pain is increased rather than
relieved by pressure, if the abdomen feels sore,
especially on the right side, or if sharp abdominal
pain is accompanied by fever, vomiting, and
stubborn constipation. If the above-mentioned
symptoms are present, no food, drink, or medicine
should be given until the doctor comes.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE EYES OR
EARS ARE AFFECTED</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Styes</h4>&nbsp;<p>generally accompany eyestrain or poor
general health. The cause should be found and
treated; and especial attention should be given to
correcting eyestrain, indigestion, and constipation.
Hot applications may be used, but if pus
gathers, the stye should be treated by a physician.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Foreign bodies in the eye</h4>&nbsp;<p>may sometimes be
removed by blowing the nose violently, by yawning
several times, or by drawing the upper lid down
over the lower. The eye should not be rubbed.
If it proves impossible to dislodge the object by
these methods or by others similar, the patient's
eyelid should be turned back in the following<!-- Page 268 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
way: Let the patient sit with his head back in a
low chair placed in a good light, and stand behind
him holding his head between your side and upper
arm. In this position the patient's head is held
firmly while both of the operator's hands are free.
Next draw down the lower lid, and remove the
object, if visible, on the corner of a clean handkerchief.
To turn back the upper lid, grasp the eyelashes
firmly, draw the lid down, out, and then up
over a match or pencil placed across the middle
line of the lid and held in your other hand. Then
wipe the object carefully away if it is visible.</p></div>

<p>Irritation that persists after the foreign body
has been removed may be relieved by a cold
compress continued for an hour or more, or by a
drop or two of castor oil placed under the lid. If
attempts to remove the foreign body prove unsuccessful,
if the injury is severe, or if irritation
continues after several hours, apply a cold compress,
bandage it firmly so that the eyeball is kept
at rest, and seek the aid of a physician.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Disorders Affecting the Ears.</h4><p>&mdash;Permanent deafness
may result from neglecting disorders of the
ears. Ear-ache, discharge from the ear, swelling
in or about it, pain or tenderness behind it, all
require medical attention and no time should be
lost in securing it. To relieve pain the patient
may lie with the ear on an ice bag, but nothing<!-- Page 269 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
whatever should be put into the ear before the
doctor comes, except when an insect has entered
the ear, and causes acute distress by the noise of
its beating wings. If such an accident has occurred,
the patient should lie on the unaffected side,
and warm sweet oil should be dropped very gently
into the affected ear by means of a medicine dropper.
The insect generally drowns in the oil and
floats to the opening of the ear canal. After it
has been removed, the patient should lie on the
affected side so that the oil may drain out of the
ear.</p></div>

<p>No attempts should be made to remove foreign
bodies from the ear or nose, unless they can be
reached easily with the fingers. Hair pins, crochet
hooks and similar instruments should never be used
for this purpose. It is best for a doctor to remove
foreign objects because unskillful attempts are
likely to move them further in.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE SKIN IS
AFFECTED</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Prickly-heat</h4><p>, which affects babies and children
more often than adults, is an eruption caused
by heat and moisture, and aggravated by flannel
underwear. It may be prevented by keeping the
skin dry and cool, and it may be relieved by bathing
the skin with alcohol and water, about one<!-- Page 270 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
part of alcohol to three of water, and by using
after the bath a powder made of two parts of
starch to one of boracic acid, or any good talcum
powder.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Insect Bites and Stings.</h4><p>&mdash;The sting, if still
in the wound, should first be removed, and then
ammonia should be applied, since the poison is generally
acid. Applications of cold water, alcohol
and water, or wet salt may relieve the subsequent
burning and itching, but ammonia is generally
most effective.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Ivy poisoning</h4>&nbsp;<p>may be treated by applying
cloths wet in a strong solution of baking soda or of
boracic acid, or by applications of carbolized vaseline
or ichthyol. Severe cases should have medical
attention. Scratching and rubbing seem to
spread the inflammation, and special care should
be taken not to rub the face or eyes with infected
hands. Susceptible people should avoid the plant
if possible.</p></div>

<h3>OTHER EMERGENCIES</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Chills</h4>&nbsp;<p>may be the result of infection or of exposure
to cold. An early diagnosis of the trouble
is so desirable that it is well to send for a doctor
even when symptoms are not severe. If a person
has a chill his temperature should be taken at
once; fever and chill together probably indicate<!-- Page 271 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
invasion by bacteria. When chills follow exposure
to cold the patient should go to bed between
warm blankets, his body should be briskly rubbed,
and hot water bags and a hot drink should be
given. If he prefers, he may take a hot bath
before going to bed.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Croup</h4>&nbsp;<p>is caused by a spasmodic closure of the
larynx so that breathing is impeded. The child
who develops croup may have a slight cold, but
frequently shows no symptoms until he wakes in
the night with a hoarse ringing cough and difficult
breathing. True croup, though often distressing,
is seldom serious, even when the symptoms are
so severe that the child appears to be partly suffocated.
An emetic should be given at once,
preferably syrup of ipecac, one teaspoonful followed
by warm water, or ten drops every 15 minutes
until the child vomits freely. Hot fomentations
may be applied to the throat and chest in
order to hasten relaxation of the muscular spasm,
and water should be kept boiling near the bed in
a teakettle or uncovered saucepan. The child
should stay in a warm room during the following
day.</p></div>

<p>Whenever a child develops a croupy cough his
throat should be examined. A physician should
be summoned if the throat is red and especially
if the redness is associated with rise in temperature.<!-- Page 272 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Cases of diphtheria have been overlooked
by neglecting such symptoms.</p>

<h3>BLEEDING</h3>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, bleeding can be
stopped by elevating the injured part and applying
pressure over the wound. One should, however,
remember that loss of blood is not the only
danger presented by an open wound, for pus-producing
germs, if they make their entrance,
may cause an infection which may be as serious
as the bleeding itself. Hence in dealing with open
wounds of any sort one should always keep in
mind the danger of infection as well as the danger
from loss of blood.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Treatment of Slight Wounds.</h4><p>&mdash;Loss of blood
from slight wounds is seldom so serious as the
danger of infection; therefore small cuts, pin
pricks, scratches, etc. should be encouraged to
bleed by pressure near the wound in order to
expel the germs that may have entered. After
the wound has bled a little, tincture of iodine
should be applied by means of a cotton swab both
to the wound itself and also to the surrounding skin.</p></div>

<p>After the wound has thus been disinfected it
should be covered with a sterile dressing; a sterile
or aseptic dressing is material in which all bacterial
life has been destroyed. Gauze from a First<!-- Page 273 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Aid dressing or from a packet of sterile gauze
should be used for this compress, or gauze may be cut
from a sterile bandage. The compress serves two
purposes: it protects the wound from infection, and
if applied with pressure it checks further bleeding.</p>

<p>The compress should be securely bandaged in
place, or its edges may be fastened with adhesive
plaster or collodion. Neither of the two latter
should cover the wound itself. The outside bandage
may be changed when soiled, but the compress
itself should not be disturbed until the wound
has healed. It is a mistake to dress wounds
oftener than necessary, since handling them always
increases the chance of introducing germs. Most
children, like Tom Sawyer, delight in wounds,
but they should be prevented if possible both from
inspecting and from exhibiting them.</p>

<p>If heat, swelling, redness, or pain develop in a
wound after a day or two, a doctor should be consulted;
and not a minute should be lost if the
patient has a chill or if red streaks appear extending
from the wound in the general direction of the
heart. Until the doctor comes the wounded part
should be elevated and covered with cold applications
wet in alcohol 25%, or in a solution of common
salt, a teaspoonful to a pint of water.</p>

<p>Several points should be remembered in dressing
wounds. In the first place the mouth, which<!-- Page 274 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
is full of germs, is not a good place for cut fingers.
Moreover, wounds should not be touched by
anything, especially the fingers, either washed or
unwashed, nor should the scissors, fingers or other
object be allowed to touch the surface of the
dressing that is to be placed directly upon a wound.
Unless they contain gross dirt wounds should not
be washed with water, since washing introduces
another chance of infection and accomplishes
nothing except a tidy appearance, which is not
essential. Furthermore, it should be remembered
that exposure to the air will not infect a wound,
and therefore time should be taken to find a suitable
dressing. When a sterile dressing is quite
impossible to obtain, the cleanest material available
should be used; one of the best substitutes
for a sterile dressing is the inner surface of a handkerchief
or napkin that has not previously been
unfolded since it was ironed. It is a common mistake
to tie up a wound in the first article presented,
which is usually a generous by-stander's soiled
handkerchief. The same precautions in regard to
cleanliness should be taken in dressing wounds
that are known to be contaminated, since even
into an infected wound it is possible to introduce
more germs and more virulent ones.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Nosebleed</h4>&nbsp;<p>usually stops of itself, but if it is
obstinate the patient should sit erect with the<!-- Page 275 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
head back, and cold compresses should be placed
on the nose and at the back of the neck. Pressure
should be made on the upper lip by means of
the fingers, or by a firm roll of paper or cotton
placed under the upper lip. Salt or vinegar in
water, a teaspoonful of either one to a cup of
water, may be snuffed up the nose. The treatment
should be continued for ten or fifteen minutes,
or until bleeding stops; if the bleeding persists
a doctor is needed.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Profuse menstruation</h4>&nbsp;<p>should be treated by
keeping the patient quiet in bed with the head low
and the feet slightly elevated. "Any marked
increase, whether by amount, duration, or shortening
of the interval between the periods ought
to receive attention and be brought to the physician's
notice" (Latimer). Painful menstruation
may be relieved by rest in bed, mental as well as
physical, by hot drinks and by the application of
heat. Rest, and hygienic living persistently practised,
will relieve most menstrual abnormalities.
The common practice of using patent remedies
and alcoholic liquors for disordered menstruation
cannot be too strongly condemned.</p></div>

<h3>OTHER INJURIES</h3>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Sprains.</h4><p>&mdash;A sprain is caused by twisting,
stretching, or tearing the tissues about a joint.<!-- Page 276 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
The first sharp pain comes from the injury to the
tissues; subsequent pain is caused by the pressure
of accumulated fluid. The other symptoms are
those characteristic of inflammation.</p></div>

<p>When a sprain is slight, the affected part should
be elevated and kept at rest for the first twenty-four
hours. Either heat or cold should be applied,
or heat and cold alternately; a good treatment is to
soak the part in hot water and afterward to allow
cold water to run upon it from the tap. Gentle
rubbing with a circular motion helps to reduce the
swelling. If the joint must be used it should be
bandaged tightly.</p>

<p>Injuries to joints should never be neglected; and
severe sprains always require medical attention,
since in addition to the sprain a bone may be
broken. A severely sprained joint should be
elevated, treated with hot or cold applications,
and kept at rest until it has been examined by a
physician.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Bruises.</h4><p>&mdash;Bruises need no attention unless they
are extensive or painful. The skin should be kept
clean and if possible unbroken, since injured tissues
are less resistant to infection than tissues in
their normal state. Applications of cold water or
of equal parts of cold water and alcohol may relieve
the pain, but cold should not be used upon
bruises that are extensive. A compress bandaged<!-- Page 277 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
tightly in place may help to prevent swelling and
discoloration.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Burns and Scalds.</h4><p>&mdash;Injuries from dry heat are
called burns, and those from moist heat are called
scalds. Both are painful, and both are dangerous
if extensive or deep. Burns and scalds require
medical attention if the injured area is extensive,
if a large blister is formed, if the skin is destroyed
or charred, and if symptoms of shock appear.
Shock often follows burns or scalds even when
the injury is comparatively slight.</p></div>

<p>Treatment of slight burns, where the skin is
reddened but not destroyed, has for its main object
the exclusion of air. One of the following
may be applied: dry baking soda, or baking soda
made into a paste with water, picric acid gauze
moistened in water, boracic acid ointment, vaseline,
sweet oil, or castor oil; if none of these is obtainable,
lard, cream, the white of an egg or unsalted
butter may be used. Old muslin or linen bandaged
lightly in place, should be used to cover the burn.</p>

<p>The same treatment is used for sunburn, and
also for small burns where blisters form. A
blister, if it forms, should not be punctured; but if
it is accidentally broken the skin of the blister
should not be removed. It should be remembered
that a broken blister is an open wound, and therefore
liable to infection.</p>

<p><!-- Page 278 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Brush burn</h4>&nbsp;<p>is a name given to injuries where the
surface of the skin has been removed. They include
the scraped arms and legs which are common
accidents in childhood. In order to dress a
brush burn, particles of dirt should first be removed
preferably by means of forceps that have
been boiled, and the surrounding skin should then
be cleansed with soap and water. The injured
part should next be flushed with sterile salt solution,
made by boiling water five minutes and
adding to it salt in the proportion of one teaspoonful
to a pint of water. If the dirt is difficult to
remove a soap compress should be applied. To
prepare the compress several thicknesses of
gauze or muslin should be boiled in a strong
solution of castile or green soap for ten minutes.
The compress should remain in place several
hours, and may be repeated if necessary. After
the wound has been thoroughly cleansed, it
should be dressed with old muslin that has been
saturated in castor oil or spread with boracic ointment.</p></div>

<h2><span class="sm2">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<br />
SPECIAL POINTS IN THE CARE OF
CHILDREN, CONVALESCENTS, CHRONICS,
AND THE AGED</h2>

<p>In many cases of sickness institutional care has
marked advantages. It may be the only solution
when adequate provision for the sick is impossible
at home; and it is often a necessity when a patient
requires special equipment or apparatus, expert
nursing, and medical attention within reach both
day and night.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would not be desirable
even if it were possible for all sick persons to be
cared for in institutions. Care at home when it is
adequate may be more successful than equally
skillful care given elsewhere, since the sick quite
as much as the well are injured by long separation
from normal family life. Most children, because
they need the attention of their own mothers,
most convalescent and chronic patients, and most
aged persons are cared for at home; and in the
great majority of cases no better place for them
could be found. Since patients of these four
groups have needs peculiar to themselves, some<!-- Page 281 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
special points in caring for them are considered
in this chapter.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN</h3>

<p>Ability to observe quickly and accurately is
seldom more needed than it is by a woman who
cares for children. No one expects babies to
explain their troubles, but people forget that
small children are unable to describe their physical
sensations with any degree of accuracy, although
discomfort or sickness may show itself
in all degrees of ill temper and bad conduct.
For these exhibitions many a suffering child has
been punished, where an older and more articulate
person would have received considerate attention.</p>

<p>Children, like babies, have a low resistance to disease.
Moreover, they react quickly both to favorable
and to unfavorable surroundings. Hence
slight causes sometimes produce pronounced or
even violent symptoms in children without giving
cause for great anxiety, although the same symptoms
if exhibited by adults, might indicate
critical illness. On the other hand the recuperative
power of children is high, and their recoveries
are sometimes surprisingly rapid. It is a mistake,
when a child has completely recovered from
an acute but brief illness, to coddle him for weeks
afterward merely because a grown person in similar<!-- Page 282 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
circumstances would have failed to regain
his strength.</p>

<p>When a child is sick in bed, especial efforts
should be made to insure adequate ventilation
without chilling him. Children always lose heat
rapidly because the body surface is proportionately
large; when they are ill, therefore, it is especially
necessary to keep them well covered, to
see that their hands and feet are warm, and to
avoid chilling them during their baths. But overheating
must also be avoided, since all children,
sick or well, who are too warmly dressed or who
stay in rooms that are too warm, become weak and
irritable and more susceptible than others to colds
and other respiratory disorders. The child's
skin should be kept clean and dry, but he should
not be disturbed nor handled unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Sick children require very simple food at short
intervals. Variety is not so necessary for a child
as for an adult, unless the child has been allowed
to form bad habits of eating. Sick children should
not be indulged unnecessarily, either in regard to
their food or in other ways. However, attempts
made during an illness to change the habits of a
badly trained child are unwise because usually
unsuccessful; parents who sow the wind by neglecting
to train their children when they are in
good health may as well make up their minds to<!-- Page 283 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
reap a veritable whirlwind when the children are
ill. Even when children are well trained it is
difficult and sometimes impossible to prevent them
from forming bad habits during sickness. Yet
the labor of training a child reaps perhaps at no
other time a richer reward than it does when the
child is ill, and his recovery might be seriously
impeded by unwillingness to accept necessary
food, medicine, or treatment.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Physical defects</h4>&nbsp;<p>are faults in the structure of
the body; adenoid growths, imperfect eyes, abnormally
curved spines, and defective teeth are
examples. Most physical defects can be cured
in childhood by treatment or by slight operations.
If untreated they frequently lead to sickness or to
serious impairment of the body, and if neglected
until adult life their injurious consequences are
generally beyond remedy, even when the defects
themselves can be repaired.</p></div>

<p>Some indications of common physical defects
are given below; they ought to be more generally
known than they are. If a child exhibits one or
more of the symptoms mentioned, he ought to be
given a complete physical examination by a
competent physician, and treatment, if needed,
should begin without delay. The idea that children
will outgrow these defects without treatment
is erroneous. Better, however, than waiting until<!-- Page 284 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
symptoms appear is the modern way of giving
every child a physical examination at stated intervals,
a practice already common in public schools
where effective health work is carried on.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Eyestrain</h4>&nbsp;<p>frequently comes from imperfections
in the shape of the eye; these imperfections can
almost always be corrected by glasses. When a
child is suffering from eyestrain, the eyes themselves
may show indications of trouble; they may
be blood-shot, the lids may itch or be crusted or inflamed,
or styes may appear. In other cases the
symptoms of eyestrain have no apparent connection
with the eyes; such symptoms are headache,
nausea, vomiting, indigestion, fatigue, irritability,
poor scholarship, and nervous exhaustion.
If a child shows any of these symptoms, or if he
rubs his eyes, frowns, squints, wrinkles his forehead,
sits bent over his book, or develops round
shoulders, there is sufficient reason for having his
eyes examined by an oculist. Examination by an
optician should not be considered sufficient.</p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Enlarged Tonsils and Adenoids.</h4><p>&mdash;The tonsils
are masses of spongy tissue situated at the back of
the mouth, on either side of the opening into the
throat. If enlarged they may seriously interfere
with breathing, and if diseased they frequently
harbor the germs causing many acute infections,
as well as germs of rheumatism and most of the<!-- Page 285 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
heart disease originating in early life. Therefore
the tonsils ought to be removed if they are diseased
or greatly enlarged, but there is ordinarily
no good reason for removing normal tonsils.</p></div>

<p>Adenoids are situated at the back of the nose,
and like the tonsils are composed of spongy tissue.
Adenoids sometimes become so enlarged that they
interfere with the passage of air through the nose,
thus predisposing to catarrh, colds, and other
respiratory diseases, to high palate with irregular
teeth, to inflammation of the middle ear leading to
deafness, to diminished mental activity, and to
general poor health.</p>

<p>If a child breathes through his mouth, if he
snores at night, keeps his mouth open and has a
dull, apathetic expression, his nose and throat
should be examined, and if advisable his tonsils
and adenoids should be removed.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Defective Hearing.</h4><p>&mdash;Permanent deafness among
children in the great majority of cases comes
from trouble in the throat or nose; hence the most
effective measure to prevent deafness is to make
sure that every child's nose, throat, and mouth
are in a normal condition. Sensitive or timid
children try to hide infirmities of any kind, but
deaf children seem peculiarly unable to explain
their difficulties. "No one," says Cornell, "has
ever recorded that a small child complained of<!-- Page 286 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
inability to hear." A child's ears should be
examined if he breathes through his mouth, if he
stoops habitually, if he is persistently inattentive,
or if he is vague or stupid in carrying out directions.
A child who appears normal at times and
inattentive or stupid at other times should also
be examined, since he may be deaf in one ear.</p></div>

<p>Temporary deafness may come from accumulated
wax in the ear. The wax should be removed
by a doctor; inexpert attempts are likely
to cause serious injury to the ear drum. Intermittent
deafness may be caused by enlarged tonsils
and adenoids. Children thus affected are not
infrequently punished for seeming disobedience.
Such children are especially liable to street
accidents.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Defective teeth</h4>&nbsp;<p>have been considered on <a href="#Page_44">page
44.</a></p></div>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Posture.</h4><p>&mdash;In childhood the bones are soft and
yield with comparative ease to continued strains;
hence they often become deformed by bad positions
assumed in sitting, standing, or in using the
body in other ways. The postures habitually
assumed by a child should be noticed and good
postures should be insisted upon. But it is not
enough to admonish him. The various causes
tending to encourage bad positions should be
corrected; among them are insufficient illumination<!-- Page 287 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of books and work, defective eyesight or
hearing, obstructions in breathing, muscular
weakness, and low general vitality. Children
should have their chairs and tables suited to their
size for their work both at home and in school.</p></div>

<p>The adjustable chairs and desks now used in
schools are a marked improvement upon the<!-- Page 289 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
school furniture which has caused so many
deformities in the past.</p>

<p>One of the serious deformities caused by habitual
faulty posture is curvature
of the spine. A curvature not
only injures a child's appearance
and thus handicaps him
in later life, but it brings strains
and pressure upon the organs of
the chest and abdomen which
may seriously impair his health.
As curvatures often pass unnoticed
in their early stages,
every child should be inspected
occasionally when all his clothing
has been removed, to see
whether the weight is borne
evenly on both feet, whether
the development of the two
sides is uniform, and whether
the head and shoulders are
properly carried. It should be
noticed when the child stands,
whether one shoulder is higher
than the other, whether one
shoulder blade projects more than the other,
whether one hip is higher than the other, and
whether one hand is lower than the other when<!-- Page 290 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the arms are hanging at the sides. The child
should walk both toward and away from the
observer, who should notice whether the child
uses the two sides of his body in the same way,
and whether he drags or shuffles his feet or has
other abnormalities of gait.</p>

<p><!-- Page 291 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>If abnormalities are found, a physician should
be consulted. Often corrective exercises are all
that is needed, and no one should put braces
of any kind upon a child unless they have been
prescribed by a physician. No attempt should
be made to correct the common tendency of
children to toe in or "walk pigeon-toed." Toeing-in
is a natural manner of walking during the<!-- Page 292 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
formative period and tends to strengthen the
arch of the foot, while toeing-out tends to
weaken the arch and to cause flat foot or broken
arches.</p>

<div class="run-in">
<h4>Predisposition to Nervousness.</h4><p>&mdash;Heredity plays
an important r√¥le in the predisposition to nervousness,
so that children of nervous parents are particularly
likely to show nervous instability. It
is, however, difficult to say in a given case how
much of his nervousness a child inherits and how
much he acquires by imitating the irritability,
the out-breaks of temper, and the other evidences
of imperfect emotional control displayed by his
nervously disposed parents. On the other hand,
even children of nervous predisposition sometimes
overcome their defects to some extent by imitating
parents who have acquired self-control.</p></div>

<p>Children predisposed to nervousness should be
watched with special care, but they should not be
allowed to realize that they are the objects of
unusual solicitude. They need the most favorable
surroundings that can be obtained, and
their general health should be maintained at
the highest possible level. Any condition that
lowers vitality tends to increase their troubles;
nervousness may be caused among children of
good inheritance, and increased among others,
by poor nutrition, lack of exercise and play out-of-<!-- Page 293 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>doors,
fatigue, loss of sleep, eyestrain, adenoid
growths, and the poisons of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of many nervous children
that they are too easily stimulated; they may be
excitable, restless, unnaturally quick in moving,
over-sensitive to pain and discomfort, easily
fatigued, irritable in temper, and unable to control
the emotions. They frequently make involuntary
motions like grimacing and winking
the eyes. Children of low nervous tone, however,
are not necessarily excitable. A nervous child
may be muscularly weak, awkward in gait, listless,
dull, clumsy, forgetful, and inattentive.
Such children often suffer from cold hands
and feet and from profuse perspiration.</p>

<p>Much can be done for these unfortunate children
by removing the cause of their troubles if
possible, by giving them simple and wholesome
surroundings, by suiting their occupations to their
strength, by eliminating mental strain, particularly
during the adolescent period, and by training
them to control their minds as well as their
bodies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In addition to the hardening of the body, the education
of the child should include measures which increase the
resistance of the child against pain and discomforts of
various sorts. Every child, therefore, should undergo a
gradual process of 'psychic hardening' and be taught to<!-- Page 294 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
bear with equanimity the pain and discomfort to which
everyone sooner or later cannot help but be exposed.
What I have said about clothing, cold baths, walking in
all weather and at all temperatures, play and exercise in
the open air, has a bearing on this point, for a child who
has formed good habits in these various directions will
have learned many lessons in the steeling of his mind to
bear pain and to ignore small discomforts."&mdash;(Barker:
"Principles of Mental Hygiene Applied to the Management
of Children Predisposed to Nervousness.")</p></blockquote>

<h3>CONVALESCENT PATIENTS</h3>

<p>After serious or prolonged illness the vitality
is generally low and all bodily processes are likely
to be depressed. During convalescence, therefore,
the digestion is feeble, the muscles are weak
so that fatigue follows slight exertion, and the
sluggish condition of the circulation renders the
patient especially sensitive to cold. Since the
nervous system also becomes depressed and irritable,
a convalescent patient is easily excited,
easily discouraged, and quickly fatigued by mental
effort. He finds the simplest decisions hard
to make, and his emotions difficult to control;
indeed, many a patient who has borne acute pain
with unflinching courage becomes peevish at
this stage, weeps easily, and expects more expression
of sympathy than is good for him. Some
persons naturally make quick recoveries, while<!-- Page 295 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
others recuperate slowly. A long and tedious
convalescence, it should be remembered, is the
patient's misfortune rather than his fault.</p>

<p>In restoring a convalescent patient to normal
living it is imperative to proceed slowly. Food
should be increased gradually both in variety
and in amount; but the patient's appetite is not
always a safe guide, and it may need to be encouraged
or to be restrained. Both mental and
physical exertion should begin only under careful
supervision, and should increase by slow degrees.
The patient should sleep as much as possible,
should take long intervals of rest, and should continue
no occupation to the point of fatigue. A
patient who has been ill in a hospital or who has
had at home the exclusive services of a nurse or
an attendant, often finds the period following his
return or following the nurse's departure an exceedingly
difficult transition. The family should
not expect or allow him to resume too many duties
at a time when the mere acts of bathing and dressing
may demand all the strength he has. Many
convalescents are obliged, or think they are
obliged, to take up regular work again before
their strength is fully restored. There is
generally no economy in so doing; indeed, time
is saved in the end by waiting until recovery
is complete before undertaking full work.</p>

Important as it is to build up the patient's
physical strength, it is hardly less important to
direct his thoughts away from himself and his
sickness, and to help him renew his interest in
normal living. During his illness he has of necessity
relied upon the judgment and support of
other persons, and his pain and discomfort have
forced him to think constantly of himself and his
many needs. The habit of sickness is readily
broken by some persons, particularly by those
whose nervous exhaustion has not been great and
whose interests outside themselves are naturally
keen. But the sick point of view has remarkable
tenacity, and other patients, unless circumstances
or deliberate efforts redirect their thoughts, will
look upon themselves as invalids to the end of
time.</p>

<p>Hopefulness promotes health, while discouragement,
apprehension, and unhappiness lower
the tone of the whole system. Hence set backs,
failures, delays, and relapses should not be dwelt
upon, but signs of progress should be mentioned;
judiciously however, since overdone attempts
to cheer a patient seldom fail to have the opposite
effect. If objects or situations that suggest undesirable
thoughts are eliminated, the less often
those thoughts tend to recur. Therefore, in order
to break the habit of sickness, old thoughts must<!-- Page 297 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
be gradually banished and new ones must be
substituted. Sick-room appliances should be put
out of sight as soon as they are no longer needed,
and the patient may profit by moving into a different
bed room. A few days spent away from
home as soon as his strength permits often prove
effective in breaking up sickness associations;
the patient is generally encouraged when he finds
that he can sleep in a different bed, endure some
fatigue, and exist without daily visits from the
doctor. Even a day spent at a different house
in the same town sometimes directs the patient's
thoughts into fresh channels. Gradually, but
as quickly as safety allows, he should take his
place in the normal family life and cease to be
treated as an exception.</p>

<p>Merely eliminating associations with sickness,
however, is not enough; and exhorting a patient
to forget himself and to become interested in
something seldom accomplishes anything, especially
if he is so depleted by illness that the
thought of everyday activities suggests only weariness
and pain. A person so weak that he is
thoroughly fatigued by dressing himself should
not be expected to view with enthusiasm the prospect
of a full day's work. Much, however, may
be accomplished by providing something that
the patient really likes to do, and deliberate<!-- Page 298 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
efforts must be made to stimulate his interest in
some occupation, however simple it may be.</p>

<p>Occupations for invalids are more than a means
to pass away the time; they are also of distinct
curative value. The patient's interest is not always
easy to arouse, and some ingenuity may be
needed in the beginning; sometimes interest is
best aroused by working at some handicraft in
his presence, and finally offering, as a favor, to
teach him to do it also. His interest in any occupation
is invariably increased if a well person
not only directs but shares in the work.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to select occupations
suited to the patient's physical condition, to his
age, tastes, and mental development. Two or
three occupations are better than one, so that he
may change from one to another before any one
becomes tedious. Work requiring fine motions,
close attention, or concentrated thought should
be used for short periods, only, and no work should
be continued to the point of fatigue. The patient
should not be allowed to feel that he must
finish a certain amount in a certain time. Even
poor work is better than none, and a patient should
always be encouraged by judicious praise.</p>

<p>Games and puzzles are useful to some extent,
but an aimless occupation is not so beneficial as
one which has a tangible product, particularly<!-- Page 299 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
a product that is useful as well as beautiful.
Occupations frequently possible for invalids and
convalescents include knitting, crocheting, many
kinds of needle work, clay modeling, basketry,
stenciling, weaving, book-binding, metal work, and
photography. Manuals are now available giving
directions for these and many other handicrafts.
Sick children often enjoy collecting stamps, post
marks, and other objects, making scrap books,
sewing, weaving, knitting, paper folding, and
various other kindergarten occupations.</p>

<h3>CHRONIC PATIENTS</h3>

<p>The whole field of caring for the sick offers
nowhere greater opportunity for fine and finished
work than it offers in the case of chronic invalids.
It is an achievement of which an artist might be
proud to make a chronic patient comfortable in
body, happy in mind, and agreeable to others.
Moreover, since success can never be attained by
one who wearies in well doing, the care given to a
chronic invalid tests not only the attendant's
skill but also her moral and spiritual quality.</p>

<p>Care of a chronic patient has for its aims maintaining
the patient's health, rendering him as
happy and comfortable in mind and body as it is
possible for him to be, and providing whatever
special treatment and attention his case requires.<!-- Page 300 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
In order to maintain his health constant attention
must be given to diet, to hygiene of the sick room,
and indeed to all his surroundings. In many
chronic illnesses, such as rheumatism and kidney
disease, the diet is prescribed by the doctor; in
every case care should be taken that the patient is
not overfed or underfed, that the food is suited to
his digestive powers, that foods causing flatulence
are eliminated, particularly if the patient's trouble
is heart disease, and not the least important requirement,
that he derive as much pleasure from his food as possible.</p>

<p>The regular daily care of the patient and of his
room, already described in this book, should be
scrupulously carried out, and no less scrupulously
during the tenth year than it was during the tenth
day. Cleanliness in every detail is absolutely
essential to the patient's welfare; no one is more
unpleasant either to himself or to others than a
chronic patient who is neglected. Patients who
are constantly in bed, it should be remembered,
and paralyzed patients in particular, are peculiarly
susceptible to pressure sores. If a patient is
able, it is extremely important for him to sit up
in a chair part of the day. Sitting up should
never be omitted because it involves the expenditure
of time and trouble for the attendant.</p>

<p>It is often said that for most people some personal<!-- Page 301 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
experience of sickness is beneficial; it can
safely be said, however, that no one benefits from
spending any considerable portion of his life in a
state of helplessness and suffering. Behavior and
character itself are determined by influences constantly
coming into the mind from daily surroundings
and associations with other people: one who
recalls this fact needs only a moment's reflection to
realize how ill adapted to healthy development of
mind and character are the limited lives of the sick.
Especially unfortunate is the situation of chronic
invalids, shut off as they are from the objective
interests and activities of normal life, deprived of
all practice in making the salutary small adjustments
and sacrifices required in every day living
with other people, and self-centered as they necessarily
tend to become from the inevitable
focusing of attention upon their own discomforts
and pain.</p>

<p>On the whole, a surprisingly large number of
invalids successfully resist the disintegrating
effects of sickness upon character. But it is
nevertheless true, as Dr. Weir Mitchell says, that
"Sickness ennobles a few but debases many."
A selfish invalid has more than once destroyed the
happiness of an entire family, or spoiled the life of
one member of it by monopolizing her whole time
and attention. Families should remember that<!-- Page 302 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
their injudicious sacrifices seldom bring enduring
happiness or contentment to the patient himself;
indeed, in the long run such sacrifices generally
injure him even more than they injure his
victims. Clearly much must and should be
sacrificed by members of a family to the needs of
an invalid; but in general it may be said that a
sacrifice is injudicious if it relieves the patient
of activity or responsibility that he can support
without injury, if it makes him more dependent in
mind or body, if it results in restricting his attention
to himself and his affairs, or if it increases
his tendency to make demands on others.</p>

<p>Purposeful activity of some sort and the necessity
for contributing to the welfare of others are
essential parts of a wholesome life. If these
essentials are entirely eliminated from the life of
an invalid, the patient's greatest needs are probably
left unsatisfied, even though the physical
care he receives may be perfect in every detail.
All that was said in regard to occupations for
invalids applies with particular force to occupations
for chronic patients, since however valuable
manual occupations may be as a means to bring
about recovery, they are still more valuable in
furnishing interest and purpose in a life whose
only prospect is a succession of weary, useless
years. Handicapped patients sometimes learn<!-- Page 303 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
occupations that yield a financial return, and
ability to earn even a little stimulates self respect
and mental health, whether the money is needed
or not. The important point, however, is that
the finished product should have a recognized use.</p>

<p>In addition to enabling the patient to make
things with his hands, a way should be found if
possible by which he may contribute to the group
of people with whom he lives. If a way can be
discovered for him to do so, the opportunity
should not be denied him nor should his service
fail to be noted and appreciated, even if it is
nothing more than telling a story to a restless
child.</p>

<h3>CARE OF THE AGED</h3>

<p>At the end of life, as at its beginning, every
individual especially needs the interest and protection
of his own family. In ordinary circumstances
neither a baby nor an aged person can
be cared for so fittingly or so successfully in any
other place as he can be in his own home.</p>

<p>With advancing years is to be expected a general
slowing down of all the powers. In old age
both body and mind show characteristic changes,
and particularly changes causing lowered resistance
and diminished vigor. If the manner of
living is adapted to these changes, both happiness<!-- Page 304 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and usefulness may be prolonged. But so gradually
do the changes often come that they may
escape notice for a long time, and the younger
generation in looking back sometimes realizes
with regret how much earlier measures might
have been taken to prolong the usefulness and
to mitigate the discomforts of aged parents
and friends.</p>

<p>Old people are keenly sensitive to cold, since
the circulation gradually becomes less vigorous
and they take little exercise. Keeping them warm
both in bed and out adds more perhaps to their
comfort than any other one measure. They
should have warm underclothing and soft shawls
and other extra wraps. A real service will be
rendered by the person who invents a suitable
and dignified wrap for old or feeble men, who dislike
the informality of sweaters and feel disgraced
by shawls. Old persons should and can be kept
warm in bed, by providing them with hot water
bags, with warm night clothes including stockings,
by using woollen or outing flannel sheets if necessary,
and by providing a sufficient number of
light but warm bed covers. It is not always
understood that many covers do not remedy the
deficiencies of a thin mattress. If a thick mattress
or two thin mattresses cannot be provided,
a thick comforter or even many layers of<!-- Page 305 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
newspaper should be placed between the mattress
and the springs, and another thick comforter
should be placed between the mattress and the
lower sheet. Rubbing the body with warm olive
oil often affords great comfort, by improving the
circulation and thus increasing the sensation of
warmth, and also by relieving the tendency of the
skin to become dry and cracked. Poor circulation
at night may cause cramps in the muscles of
the legs; the cramps can usually be relieved by
warmth and gentle rubbing.</p>

<p>Old people frequently wish their rooms to be
very hot, both by day and by night, even as hot
as 80¬∞ or 85¬∞, but if it is possible to keep them
warm in any other way the temperature of the
room should be kept at 70¬∞. Well ventilated
rooms are highly important for old people as
for all others of low resistance, and it is entirely
possible for their rooms to be warm and yet well
ventilated. Aged persons should be carefully
guarded from chill, exposure, crowds, and infected
persons. Like little children they are peculiarly
susceptible to the respiratory diseases, which
cause many of the deaths commonly attributed
to old age.</p>

<p>Digestion usually becomes weaker than in
earlier years, and less food is needed. It should
be simple, hot, and divided into four or five meals<!-- Page 306 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
rather than three. Old people often wake at an
early hour, and hot nourishment will prevent
them from growing weak and faint while waiting
for the family breakfast. Both constipation and
looseness of the bowels are common ailments in
old age. So far as possible the bowels should be
regulated by means of diet; but muscular weakness
resulting in inability to control the bowels should
not be mistaken for and treated as diarrh≈ìa.</p>

<p>It is unwise for old people to undertake unaccustomed
or sudden muscular exertion, since
the muscular system including the heart muscle
grows weak and is generally unable to endure
great strain. The bones, moreover, grow brittle
and heal with difficulty if broken, so that
persons of advanced years no matter how active
should avoid walking on icy pavements, climbing
on chairs to reach high shelves, and placing themselves
in other insecure positions. Assistance must
be tactfully given, however, as active old people
are inclined to resent it. On the other hand,
old people should be encouraged to continue
moderate and safe activities, and to take regular
exercises suited to their strength. Although increasing
muscular weakness tends to make most
old people indolent, it is far better for them both
in mind and in body to remain as active as they
can without danger of too great fatigue. At all<!-- Page 307 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
events, they should be prevented if possible
from becoming bedridden.</p>

<p>Since in old age sight, hearing, and other special
senses become less acute, one should remember
that an old person may not notice the odor
of escaping gas, the light of a smouldering match,
or the sound of an approaching motor car, and
that he must be specially guarded from such
dangers of every day life. On account of their
dulled perceptions old people are sometimes
unjustly considered to be less intelligent than
they really are. Young people moreover should
be told, if an aged person is untidy and careless in
personal habits, that the apparent negligence is
caused by dulled perceptions and diminished
muscular control for which old people are no more
responsible than they are for failing eyesight
or for inability to hear.</p>

<p>Families should also realize that changes in
mind and character are beyond an aged person's
control and that they should not be made the
cause for remonstrance or arguing. Just as the
arteries harden with advancing years, as the bones
become brittle and as other tissues become less
flexible, so changes are likely to occur in the nervous
system. It is not surprising when the
brain substance like other tissues is becoming
less flexible, that the powers of attention should<!-- Page 308 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
weaken, that memory for recent events should
diminish, or that other mental powers should fail.
Changes in disposition are not uncommon: previously
controlled persons sometimes become
querulous and exacting, while excitable and irritable
persons become more placid. With most
old people emotions become less intense; feeble old
people hardly realize great joy or great sorrow, and
seldom look forward to death with apprehension.</p>

<p>Among the most important changes that occur
in the nervous system is its gradual loss in power
to respond to new demands. New habits are
difficult or impossible to form, and old habits are
hard to break. Attempts to break the habits
of a life time are therefore dangerous, and radical
changes in old people's ways of living are attended
by risk as well as by unhappiness. Such loss of
adaptability in the nervous system makes it
increasingly difficult for old people to assimilate
new ideas and to understand new points of view.
The feeling that the world is strange and that the
next generation has gone on without them accounts
for the tragic loneliness of many old people.
Clearly it is for those who are younger and more
flexible to bridge the gulf between the generations
by their understanding and their sympathy.</p>

<p>Physical care to whatever extent it is needed
should be given to all old people as soon as they<!-- Page 309 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
are unable to care for themselves, and thought
should be given to adapting their surroundings
and ways of living to their strength and needs,
just as they should be adapted to the strength and
needs of chronic patients. But a warning should
be given against managing old people too much.
It is hard for people who have managed their own
lives successfully for many years to be managed,
even for their own good. Indeed, it is questionable
kindness to deprive old people of all freedom
of action, even if following their own inclinations
occasionally has disastrous results. Few persons
would wish to prolong their lives if long life involved
being thwarted in every desire, and sometimes
real kindness consists in allowing old people
to do certain things that are not good for them.
Keeping them warm and letting them do as they
please will go far to make old people happy.</p>

<p>Many of the changes in old age reverse the
developing process of childhood. In youth and
age extremes meet, and the care of the aged presents
certain marked similarities to the care of
little children. Both require simple food, occupations
suited to their strength, and protection
from infections, from fatigue, and from nervous
strain; both are dependent, more or less helpless,
and for their happiness both need the affectionate
care of their own families. But in one respect<!-- Page 310 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
their needs are fundamentally different. In
childhood formation of proper habits is all important,
and in caring for children the future effect
of every word and act must be taken into consideration.
Old people, on the other hand, since
they live largely in the past and their habits are
irrevocably formed, may be indulged without
harm in ways that would demoralize a child; with
a clear conscience one may make them happy
in ways both great and small. This difference
makes possible one of the greatest pleasures
that come to one who cares for the helpless and
the sick, for of all enduring satisfactions few are
greater than the power to fill with comfort and
happiness the closing days of life.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<p>The New York City Department of Health has kindly
permitted us to include the following circulars of information
issued by the Division of Child Hygiene.</p>

<h3><span class="med">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</span><br />
THE CITY OF NEW YORK<br />

Instructions to Parents Regarding the Care of the
Mouth and Teeth.</h3>

<p>The physical examination of school children shows that in
many instances the teeth are in a decayed and unhealthy condition.</p>

<p>Decayed teeth cause an unclean mouth. Toothache and
disease of the gums may result.</p>

<p>Neglect of the first teeth is a frequent cause of decay of the
second teeth.</p>

<p>If a child has decayed teeth, it cannot properly chew its food.
Improperly chewed food and an unclean mouth cause bad digestion,
and consequently poor general health.</p>

<p>If a child is not in good health, it cannot keep up with its
studies in school. It is more likely to contract any contagious
disease, and it has not the proper chance to grow into a robust,
healthy adult.</p>

<p>If the child's teeth are decayed, it should be taken to a dentist
at once.</p>

<p>The teeth should be brushed after each meal, using a tooth
brush and tooth powder.</p>

<p>The following tooth powder is recommended:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 oz. powdered precipitated chalk.</li>
<li>¬Ω oz. powdered Castile soap,</li>
<li>1 dram powdered orris root.</li>
<li>Thoroughly mix.</li>
</ul>

<p>This prescription can be filled by any druggist at a cost not
to exceed fifteen cents.</p>

<h3><span class="med">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</span><br />
CITY OF NEW YORK<br />

Instructions to Parents Regarding the Care of the
Nose</h3>

<p>The physical examination of school children shows that in
many instances they breathe through the mouth because they
cannot breathe properly or sufficiently through the nose.</p>

<p>This may be due to bad habits in regard to keeping the nose
clean, or, in a majority of instances, to a growth which is known
as "adenoids" and which stops up the back of the nose. In
either case, the air is not breathed through the nose, and the child
becomes what is known as a "mouth breather."</p>

<p>Constant breathing through the mouth causes the child to
become pale, restless in its sleep and dull in its actions. The
child often speaks as though it had a cold in the head. Frequently
there is an almost constant discharge from the nose.</p>

<p>Mouth breathing renders a child especially liable to contract
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases; in fact, the child has
very little resistance to disease of any kind.</p>

<p>Every child should be given a handkerchief, and be taught
to thoroughly blow the nose several times each day. If, after
doing this regularly, the child is still unable to breathe properly
through the nose, it is probable that an adenoid growth is present.
Such children should be taken to the family physician or to a
dispensary for further advice and treatment.</p>

<p>Do not wait too long in the hope that the child will outgrow
the condition, for the effect of adenoid growths persisting throughout
childhood may injure the person for life.</p>

<p>Have your child's throat and nose examined one month after
measles, scarlet fever, or diphtheria.</p>

<h3><span class="med">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</span><br />
CITY OF NEW YORK<br />

Instructions to Parents on the Care of Children's
Hair and Scalp</h3>

<p>Children affected with vermin of the head are excluded
from school. The following directions will cure the condition:</p>

<p>Mix one-half pint of sweet oil and one-half pint of kerosene
oil. Shake the mixture well and saturate the hair
with the mixture. Then wrap the head in a large bath
towel or rubber cap so that the head is entirely covered; the
head must remain covered from six to eight hours.</p>

<p>(Tincture of larkspur may be used instead of oil mixture.
The directions for use are the same.)</p>

<p>After removing the towel, the head should be shampooed
as follows:</p>

<p>To two quarts of warm water add one teaspoonful of
sodium carbonate (washing soda). Wet the hair with this
solution and then apply Castile soap and rub the head thoroughly
about ten minutes. Wash the soap out of the hair
with repeated washings of clear warm water. Dry the hair
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Nits: If the head is shampooed regularly each week as
above described, it will cure and prevent the condition of
"nits."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
